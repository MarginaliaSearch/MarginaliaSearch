# Marginalia Search

This is the source code for [Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu). 

The aim of the project is to develop new and alternative discovery methods for the Internet. 
It's an experimental workshop as much as it is a public service, the overarching goal is to
elevate the more human, non-commercial sides of the Internet. A side-goal is to do this without
requiring datacenters and expensive enterprise hardware, to run this operation on affordable hardware.

## Set up

Start by running [⚙️ run/setup.sh](run/setup.sh). This will download supplementary model data that is necessary to run the code. 
These are also necessary to run the tests. 

To set up a local test environment, follow the instructions in [📄 run/readme.md](run/readme.md)!
