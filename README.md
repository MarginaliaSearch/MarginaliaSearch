# marginalia.nu

This is the source code for marginalia.nu, including the [search engine](https://search.marginalia.nu), 
the [MEMEX/gemini server](https://memex.marginalia.nu), the and the [encyclopedia service](https://encyclopedia.marginalia.nu). 

The aim of the project is to develop new and alternative discovery methods for the Internet. 
It's an experimental workshop as much as it is a public service, the overarching goal is to
elevate the more human, non-commercial sides of the Internet. A side-goal is to do this without
requiring datacenters and expensive enterprise hardware, to run this operation on affordable hardware.

The canonical git server for this project is [https://git.marginalia.nu](https://git.marginalia.nu).
It is fine to mirror it on other hosts, but if you have issues or questions
git.marginalia.nu is where you want to go.

As it stands now, the project is still being set up and is a bit of a mess as 
it wasn't developed with the intention of going open source, a lot of tests
and so on make assumptions about the directory structure, much configuration 
is hard coded and so on. Please stand by. A lot of the mess is fairly superficial.
