# Website Adjacencies Calculator

This job updates the website similarity table based on the data in the domain and links-tables in the URL database.

It performs a brute force cosine similarity calculation across the entire link graph.  

These adjacencies power the [explorer service](../../services-satellite/explorer-service) and 
[random websites](../../features-search/random-websites)-functionality.
