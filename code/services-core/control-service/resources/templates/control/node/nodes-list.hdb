        It appears no nodes have been configured!  This is necessary before any index or executor services
        can be started.  At least a single node needs to be configured to serve search queries.

        <p>
            Index nodes are processing units.  The search engine requires at least one, but more can be added
            to spread the system load across multiple physical disks or even multiple servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            New index nodes register themselves automatically upon start-up.  They can't be fully removed,
            but can be disabled in the settings.
