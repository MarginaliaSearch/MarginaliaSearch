    <h1>Syntax</h1>
    This is a keyword-based search engine. When entering multiple search terms, the search engine will
    attempt to match them against documents where the terms occur in close proximity.<p>

    Search terms can be excluded with a hyphen.<p>

    While the search engine at present does not allow full text search, quotes can be used to
    specifically search for names or terms in the title. Using quotes will also cause the search engine
    to be as literal as possible in interpreting the query.<p>

    Parentheses can be used to add terms to the query without giving weight to the terms when ranking
    the search results.<p>

    <h2>Samples</h2>
    <dl class="query-samples">
        <dt>soup -chicken</dt>
        <dd>Look for keywords that contain <sample>soup</sample>, but not
            <sample>chicken</sample>.</dd>
        <dt>"keyboard"</dt>
            <dd>Look for pages containing the exact word
                <sample>keyboard</sample>, not <sample>keyboards</sample> or the like.</dd>
        <dt>"steve mcqueen"</dt>
        <dd>Look for pages containing the exact words <sample>steve mcqueen</sample>
            in that order, with no words in between.</dd>
        <dt>apology (plato)</dt>
        <dd>Look for pages containing <sample>apology</sample> and <sample>plato</sample>, but only rank them
            based on their relevance to <sample>apology</sample></dd>
