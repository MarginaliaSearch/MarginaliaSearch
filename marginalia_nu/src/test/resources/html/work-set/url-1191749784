  <pre>OpenSSH 8.5 was released on 2021-03-03. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:

Future deprecation notice
=========================

It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K.

In the SSH protocol, the "ssh-rsa" signature scheme uses the SHA-1
hash algorithm in conjunction with the RSA public key algorithm.
OpenSSH will disable this signature scheme by default in the near
future.

Note that the deactivation of "ssh-rsa" signatures does not necessarily
require cessation of use for RSA keys. In the SSH protocol, keys may be
capable of signing using multiple algorithms. In particular, "ssh-rsa"
keys are capable of signing using "rsa-sha2-256" (RSA/SHA256),
"rsa-sha2-512" (RSA/SHA512) and "ssh-rsa" (RSA/SHA1). Only the last of
these is being turned off by default.

This algorithm is unfortunately still used widely despite the
existence of better alternatives, being the only remaining public key
signature algorithm specified by the original SSH RFCs that is still
enabled by default.

The better alternatives include:

 * The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332">RFC8332</a> RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
   algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
   "ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
   supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
   client and server support them.

 * The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8709">RFC8709</a> ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported
   in OpenSSH since release 6.5.

 * The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656">RFC5656</a> ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
   have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.

To check whether a server is using the weak ssh-rsa public key
algorithm, for host authentication, try to connect to it after
removing the ssh-rsa algorithm from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>'s allowed list:

    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host

If the host key verification fails and no other supported host key
types are available, the server software on that host should be
upgraded.

This release enables the UpdateHostKeys option by default to assist
the client by automatically migrating to better algorithms.

Security
========

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: fixed a double-free memory corruption that was
   introduced in OpenSSH 8.2 . We treat all such memory faults as
   potentially exploitable. This bug could be reached by an attacker
   with access to the agent socket.

   On modern operating systems where the OS can provide information
   about the user identity connected to a socket, OpenSSH ssh-agent
   and sshd limit agent socket access only to the originating user
   and root. Additional mitigation may be afforded by the system's
   malloc(3)/free(3) implementation, if it detects double-free
   conditions.

   The most likely scenario for exploitation is a user forwarding an
   agent either to an account shared with a malicious user or to a
   host with an attacker holding root access.

 * Portable <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Prevent excessively long username going to PAM.
   This is a mitigation for a buffer overflow in Solaris' PAM username
   handling (CVE-2020-14871), and is only enabled for Sun-derived PAM
   implementations.  This is not a problem in sshd itself, it only
   prevents sshd from being used as a vector to attack Solaris' PAM.
   It does not prevent the bug in PAM from being exploited via some
   other PAM application. GH<a href="https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/212">PR212</a>


Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: this release changes the first-preference signature
   algorithm from ECDSA to ED25519.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: set the TOS/DSCP specified in the configuration
   for interactive use prior to TCP connect. The connection phase of
   the SSH session is time-sensitive and often explicitly interactive.
   The ultimate interactive/bulk TOS/DSCP will be set after
   authentication completes.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove the pre-standardization cipher
   rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se. It is an alias for aes256-cbc before
   it was standardized in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253">RFC4253</a> (2006), has been deprecated and
   disabled by default since OpenSSH 7.2 (2016) and was only briefly
   documented in ssh.1 in 2001.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: update/replace the experimental post-quantum
   hybrid key exchange method based on Streamlined NTRU Prime coupled
   with X25519.

   The previous sntrup4591761x25519-sha512@tinyssh.org method is
   replaced with sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com. Per its
   designers, the sntrup4591761 algorithm was superseded almost two
   years ago by sntrup761.

   (note this both the updated method and the one that it replaced are
   disabled by default)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: disable CheckHostIP by default. It provides insignificant
   benefits while making key rotation significantly more difficult,
   especially for hosts behind IP-based load-balancers.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.4
=========================

New features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: this release enables UpdateHostkeys by default subject to
   some conservative preconditions:
    - The key was matched in the UserKnownHostsFile (and not in the
      GlobalKnownHostsFile).
    - The same key does not exist under another name.
    - A certificate host key is not in use.
    - known_hosts contains no matching wildcard hostname pattern.
    - VerifyHostKeyDNS is not enabled.
    - The default UserKnownHostsFile is in use.

   We expect some of these conditions will be modified or relaxed in
   future.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a new LogVerbose configuration directive for
   that allows forcing maximum debug logging by file/function/line
   pattern-lists.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when prompting the user to accept a new hostkey, display
   any other host names/addresses already associated with the key.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow UserKnownHostsFile=none to indicate that no
   known_hosts file should be used to identify host keys.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add a ssh_config KnownHostsCommand option that allows the
   client to obtain known_hosts data from a command in addition to
   the usual files.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add a ssh_config PermitRemoteOpen option that allows the
   client to restrict the destination when RemoteForward is used
   with SOCKS.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: for FIDO keys, if a signature operation fails with a
   "incorrect PIN" reason and no PIN was initially requested from the
   user, then request a PIN and retry the operation. This supports
   some biometric devices that fall back to requiring PIN when reading
   of the biometric failed, and devices that require PINs for all
   hosted credentials.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: implement client address-based rate-limiting via new
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> PerSourceMaxStartups and PerSourceNetBlockSize
   directives that provide more fine-grained control on a per-origin
   address basis than the global MaxStartups limit.

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Prefix keyboard interactive prompts with "(user@host)" to
   make it easier to determine which connection they are associated
   with in cases like scp -3, ProxyJump, etc. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3224">bz#3224</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix sshd_config SetEnv directives located inside Match
   blocks. GH<a href="https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/201">PR201</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when requesting a FIDO token touch on stderr, inform the
   user once the touch has been recorded.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: prevent integer overflow when ridiculously large
   ConnectTimeout values are specified, capping the effective value
   (for most platforms) at 24 days. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3229">bz#3229</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: consider the ECDSA key subtype when ordering host key
   algorithms in the client.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: rename the PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes keyword to
   PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms. The previous name incorrectly suggested
   that it control allowed key algorithms, when this option actually
   specifies the signature algorithms that are accepted. The previous
   name remains available as an alias. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3253">bz#3253</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: similarly, rename HostbasedKeyTypes (ssh) and
   HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes (sshd) to HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: add missing lsetstat@openssh.com documentation
   and advertisement in the server's SSH2_FXP_VERSION hello packet.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: more strictly enforce KEX state-machine by
   banning packet types once they are received. Fixes memleak caused
   by duplicate SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST (oss-fuzz #30078).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: allow the full range of UIDs/GIDs for chown/chgrp on 32bit
   platforms instead of being limited by LONG_MAX. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3206">bz#3206</a>

 * Minor man page fixes (capitalization, commas, etc.) <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3223">bz#3223</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: when doing an sftp recursive upload or download of a
   read-only directory, ensure that the directory is created with
   write and execute permissions in the interim so that the transfer
   can actually complete, then set the directory permission as the
   final step. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3222">bz#3222</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: document the -Z, check the validity of its argument
   earlier and provide a better error message if it's not correct.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2879">bz#2879</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: ignore comments at the end of config lines in ssh_config,
   similar to what we already do for sshd_config. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2320">bz#2320</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: mention that DisableForwarding is valid in a
   sshd_config Match block. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3239">bz3239</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: fix incorrect sorting of "ls -ltr" under some
   circumstances. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3248">bz3248</a>.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix potential integer truncation of (unlikely)
   timeout values. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3250">bz#3250</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: make hostbased authentication send the signature algorithm
   in its SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST packets instead of the key type.
   This make HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms do what it is supposed to -
   filter on signature algorithm and not key type.

Portability
-----------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a number of platform-specific syscalls to the Linux
   seccomp-bpf sandbox. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3232">bz#3232</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3260">bz#3260</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove debug message from sigchld handler that could cause
   deadlock on some platforms. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3259">bz#3259</a>

 * Sync contrib/ssh-copy-id with upstream.

 * unittests: add a hostname function for systems that don't have it.
   Some systems don't have a hostname command (it's not required by
   POSIX). The do have uname -n (which is), but not all of those have
   it report the FQDN.

Future deprecation notice
=========================

It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K. For this reason, we will be
disabling the "ssh-rsa" public key signature algorithm by default in a
near-future release.

This algorithm is unfortunately still used widely despite the
existence of better alternatives, being the only remaining public key
signature algorithm specified by the original SSH RFCs.

The better alternatives include:

 * The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332">RFC8332</a> RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
   algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
   "ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been

We intend to enable UpdateHostKeys by default in the next OpenSSH
release. This will assist the client by automatically migrating to
better algorithms. Users may consider enabling this option manually.

Security
========

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: restrict ssh-agent from signing web challenges for
   FIDO/U2F keys.

   When signing messages in ssh-agent using a FIDO key that has an
   application string that does not start with "ssh:", ensure that the
   message being signed is one of the forms expected for the SSH protocol
   (currently public key authentication and sshsig signatures).

   This prevents ssh-agent forwarding on a host that has FIDO keys
   attached granting the ability for the remote side to sign challenges
   for web authentication using those keys too.

   Note that the converse case of web browsers signing SSH challenges is
   already precluded because no web RP can have the "ssh:" prefix in the
   application string that we require.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Enable FIDO 2.1 credProtect extension when generating
   a FIDO resident key.

   The recent FIDO 2.1 Client to Authenticator Protocol introduced a
   "credProtect" feature to better protect resident keys. We use this
   option to require a PIN prior to all operations that may retrieve
   a resident key from a FIDO token.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * For FIDO/U2F support, OpenSSH recommends the use of libfido2 1.5.0
   or greater. Older libraries have limited support at the expense of
   disabling particular features. These include resident keys, PIN-
   required keys and multiple attached tokens.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: the format of the attestation information optionally
   recorded when a FIDO key is generated has changed. It now includes
   the authenticator data needed to validate attestation signatures. 

 * The API between OpenSSH and the FIDO token middleware has changed
   and the SSH_SK_VERSION_MAJOR version has been incremented as a
   result. Third-party middleware libraries must support the current
   API version (7) to work with OpenSSH 8.4.

 * The portable OpenSSH distribution now requires automake to rebuild
   the configure script and supporting files. This is not required when
   simply building portable OpenSSH from a release tar file.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.3
=========================

New features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: support for FIDO keys that require a PIN for
   each use. These keys may be generated using ssh-keygen using a new
   "verify-required" option. When a PIN-required key is used, the user
   will be prompted for a PIN to complete the signature operation.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: authorized_keys now supports a new "verify-required"
   option to require FIDO signatures assert that the token verified
   that the user was present before making the signature. The FIDO
   protocol supports multiple methods for user-verification, but
   currently OpenSSH only supports PIN verification.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: add support for verifying FIDO webauthn
   signatures. Webauthn is a standard for using FIDO keys in web
   browsers. These signatures are a slightly different format to plain
   FIDO signatures and thus require explicit support.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow some keywords to expand shell-style ${ENV}
   environment variables. The supported keywords are CertificateFile,
   ControlPath, IdentityAgent and IdentityFile, plus LocalForward and
   RemoteForward when used for Unix domain socket paths. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3140">bz#3140</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: allow some additional control over the use of
   ssh-askpass via a new $SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE environment variable,
   including forcibly enabling and disabling its use. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69">bz#69</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a>'s AddKeysToAgent keyword accept a time
   limit for keys in addition to its current flag options. Time-
   limited keys will automatically be removed from ssh-agent after
   their expiry time has passed.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: allow the -A flag to explicitly enable agent
   forwarding in scp and sftp. The default remains to not forward an
   agent, even when ssh_config enables it.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add a '%k' TOKEN that expands to the effective HostKey of
   the destination. This allows, e.g., keeping host keys in individual
   files using "UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts.d/%k". <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1654">bz#1654</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add %-TOKEN, environment variable and tilde expansion to
   the UserKnownHostsFile directive, allowing the path to be
   completed by the configuration (e.g. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1654">bz#1654</a>)

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: better support for multiple attached FIDO
   tokens. In cases where OpenSSH cannot unambiguously determine which
   token to direct a request to, the user is now required to select a
   token by touching it. In cases of operations that require a PIN to
   be verified, this avoids sending the wrong PIN to the wrong token
   and incrementing the token's PIN failure counter (tokens
   effectively erase their keys after too many PIN failures).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix Include before Match in sshd_config; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3122">bz#3122</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: close stdin/out/error when forking after authentication
   completes ("ssh -f ...") <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3137">bz#3137</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: limit the amount of channel input data buffered,
   avoiding peers that advertise large windows but are slow to read
   from causing high memory consumption.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: handle multiple requests sent in a single write() to
   the agent.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow sshd_config longer than 256k

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: avoid spurious "Unable to load host key" message when sshd
   load a private key but no public counterpart

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: prefer the default hostkey algorithm list whenever we have
   a hostkey that matches its best-preference algorithm.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.1">sshd(1)</a>: when ordering the hostkey algorithms to request from a
   server, prefer certificate types if the known_hosts files contain a key
   marked as a @cert-authority; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3157">bz#3157</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: perform host key fingerprint comparisons for the "Are you
   sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?"
   prompt with case sensitivity.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: ensure that address/masklen mismatches in sshd_config
   yield fatal errors at daemon start time rather than later when
   they are evaluated.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: ensure that certificate extensions are lexically
   sorted. Previously if the user specified a custom extension then
   the everything would be in order except the custom ones. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3198">bz#3198</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: also compare username when checking for JumpHost loops.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3057">bz#3057</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: preserve group/world read permission on known_hosts
   files across runs of "ssh-keygen -Rf /path". The old behaviour was
   to remove all rights for group/other. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3146">bz#3146</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Mention the [-a rounds] flag in the ssh-keygen
   manual page and usage().

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: explicitly construct path to ~/.ssh/rc rather than
   relying on it being relative to the current directory, so that it
   can still be found if the shell startup changes its directory.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3185">bz#3185</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: when redirecting sshd's log output to a file, undo this
   redirection after the session child process is forked(). Fixes
   missing log messages when using this feature under some
   circumstances.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: start ClientAliveInterval bookkeeping before first pass
   through select() loop; fixed theoretical case where busy sshd may
   ignore timeouts from client.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: only reset the ServerAliveInterval check when we receive
   traffic from the server and ignore traffic from a port forwarding
   client, preventing a client from keeping a connection alive when
   it should be terminated. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2265">bz#2265</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: avoid spurious error message when ssh-keygen
   creates files outside ~/.ssh

 * sftp-client(1): fix off-by-one error that caused sftp downloads to
   make one more concurrent request that desired. This prevented using
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> in unpipelined request/response mode, which is useful when
   debugging. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3054">bz#3054</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: handle EINTR in waitfd() and timeout_connect()
   helpers. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3071">bz#3071</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: defer creation of ~/.ssh until we attempt to
   write to it so we don't leave an empty .ssh directory when it's not
   needed. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3156">bz#3156</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix multiplier when parsing time specifications
   when handling seconds after other units. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3171">bz#3171</a>

Portability
-----------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: always send any PAM account messages. If the PAM account
   stack returns any messages, always send them to the user and not
   just if the check succeeds. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2049">bz#2049</a>

 * Implement some backwards compatibility for libfido2 libraries
   older than 1.5.0. Note that use of an older library will result
   in the loss of certain features including resident key support,
   PIN support and support for multiple attached tokens.

 * configure fixes for XCode 12

 * gnome-ssh-askpass3: ensure the "close" button is not focused by
   default for SSH_ASKPASS_PROMPT=none prompts. Avoids space/enter
   accidentally dismissing FIDO touch notifications.

 * gnome-ssh-askpass3: allow some control over textarea colour via
   $GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_FG_COLOR and $GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_BG_COLOR
   environment variables.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: document another PAM spec problem in a frustrated comment

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: support NetBSD's utmpx.ut_ss address field. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=960">bz#960</a>

 * Add the ssh-sk-helper binary and its manpage to the RPM spec file

Future deprecation notice
=========================

It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K. For this reason, we will be
disabling the "ssh-rsa" public key signature algorithm by default in a
near-future release.

This algorithm is unfortunately still used widely despite the
existence of better alternatives, being the only remaining public key
signature algorithm specified by the original SSH RFCs.

The better alternatives include:

 * The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332">RFC8332</a> RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
   algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
   "ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
   supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
   client and server support them.

 * The ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported in
   OpenSSH since release 6.5.

 * The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656">RFC5656</a> ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
   have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.

To check whether a server is using the weak ssh-rsa public key
algorithm, for host authentication, try to connect to it after
removing the ssh-rsa algorithm from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>'s allowed list:

    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host

If the host key verification fails and no other supported host key
types are available, the server software on that host should be
upgraded.

A future release of OpenSSH will enable UpdateHostKeys by default
to allow the client to automatically migrate to better algorithms.
Users may consider enabling this option manually. Vendors of devices
that implement the SSH protocol should ensure that they support the
new signature algorithms for RSA keys.

Security
========

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: when receiving files, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> could be become desynchronised
   if a utimes(2) system call failed. This could allow file contents
   to be interpreted as file metadata and thereby permit an adversary
   to craft a file system that, when copied with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> in a
   configuration that caused utimes(2) to fail (e.g. under a SELinux
   policy or syscall sandbox), transferred different file names and
   contents to the actual file system layout.

   Exploitation of this is not likely as utimes(2) does not fail under
   normal circumstances. Successful exploitation is not silent - the
   output of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> would show transfer errors followed by the actual
   file(s) that were received.

   Finally, filenames returned from the peer are (since openssh-8.0)
   matched against the user's requested destination, thereby
   disallowing a successful exploit from writing files outside the
   user's selected target glob (or directory, in the case of a
   recursive transfer). This ensures that this attack can achieve no
   more than a hostile peer is already able to achieve within the scp
   protocol.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: reject an argument of "-1" in the same way as <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> do instead of accepting and silently ignoring it.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.2
=========================

The focus of this release is bug fixing.

New Features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: make IgnoreRhosts a tri-state option: "yes" to ignore
   rhosts/shosts, "no" allow rhosts/shosts or (new) "shosts-only"
   to allow .shosts files but not .rhosts.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow the IgnoreRhosts directive to appear anywhere in a
   sshd_config, not just before any Match blocks; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3148">bz3148</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add %TOKEN percent expansion for the LocalFoward and
   RemoteForward keywords when used for Unix domain socket forwarding.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3014">bz#3014</a>

 * all: allow loading public keys from the unencrypted envelope of a
   private key file if no corresponding public key file is present.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: prefer to use chacha20 from libcrypto where
   possible instead of the (slower) portable C implementation included
   in OpenSSH.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: add ability to dump the contents of a binary key
   revocation list via "ssh-keygen -lQf /path" <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3132">bz#3132</a>

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix IdentitiesOnly=yes to also apply to keys loaded from
   a PKCS11Provider; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3141">bz#3141</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: avoid NULL dereference when trying to convert an
   invalid <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716">RFC4716</a> private key.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: when performing remote-to-remote copies using "scp -3",
   start the second <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> channel with BatchMode=yes enabled to
   avoid confusing and non-deterministic ordering of prompts.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: when signing a challenge using a FIDO token,
   perform hashing of the message to be signed in the middleware layer
   rather than in OpenSSH code. This permits the use of security key
   middlewares that perform the hashing implicitly, such as Windows
   Hello.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix incorrect error message for "too many known hosts
   files." <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3149">bz#3149</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: make failures when establishing "Tunnel" forwarding
   terminate the connection when ExitOnForwardFailure is enabled;
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3116">bz#3116</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: fix printing of fingerprints on private keys and add
   a regression test for same.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: document order of checking AuthorizedKeysFile (first) and
   AuthorizedKeysCommand (subsequently, if the file doesn't match);
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3134">bz#3134</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: document that /etc/hosts.equiv and /etc/shosts.equiv are
   not considered for HostbasedAuthentication when the target user is
   root; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3148">bz#3148</a>
 
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: fix NULL dereference in private certificate
   key parsing (oss-fuzz #20074).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: more consistency between sets of %TOKENS are
   accepted in various configuration options.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: improve error messages for some common
   PKCS#11 C_Login failure cases; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3130">bz#3130</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: make error messages for problems during SSH banner
   exchange consistent with other SSH transport-layer error messages
   and ensure they include the relevant IP addresses <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3129">bz#3129</a>

 * various: fix a number of spelling errors in comments and debug/error
   messages

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: when downloading FIDO2 resident keys
   from a token, don't prompt for a PIN until the token has told us
   that it needs one. Avoids double-prompting on devices that
   implement on-device authentication.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: no-touch-required FIDO certificate option
   should be an extension, not a critical option.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: offer a better error message
   when trying to use a FIDO key function and SecurityKeyProvider is
   empty.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.8">ssh-agent(8)</a>: ensure that a key lifetime fits within
   the values allowed by the wire format (u32). Prevents integer
   wraparound of the timeout values. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3119">bz#3119</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: detect and prevent trivial configuration loops when using
    ProxyJump. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3057">bz#3057</a>.
    
Portability
-----------

 * Detect systems where signals flagged with SA_RESTART will interrupt
   select(2). POSIX permits implementations to choose whether
   select(2) will return when interrupted with a SA_RESTART-flagged
   signal, but OpenSSH requires interrupting behaviour.

 * Several compilation fixes for HP/UX and AIX.

 * On platforms that do not support setting process-wide routing
   domains (all excepting OpenBSD at present), fail to accept a
   configuration attempts to set one at process start time rather than
   fatally erroring at run time. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3126">bz#3126</a>

 * Improve detection of egrep (used in regression tests) on platforms
   that offer a poor default one (e.g. Solaris).

 * A number of shell portability fixes for the regression tests.

 * Fix theoretical infinite loop in the glob(3) replacement
   implementation.

 * Fix seccomp sandbox compilation problems for some Linux
   configurations <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3085">bz#3085</a>

 * Improved detection of libfido2 and some compilation fixes for some
   configurations when --with-security-key-builtin is selected.

   client and server support them.

 * The ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported in
   OpenSSH since release 6.5.

 * The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656">RFC5656</a> ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
   have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.

To check whether a server is using the weak ssh-rsa public key
algorithm for host authentication, try to connect to it after
removing the ssh-rsa algorithm from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>'s allowed list:

    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host

If the host key verification fails and no other supported host key
types are available, the server software on that host should be
upgraded.

A future release of OpenSSH will enable UpdateHostKeys by default
to allow the client to automatically migrate to better algorithms.
Users may consider enabling this option manually.

Security
========

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: this release removes the "ssh-rsa"
   (RSA/SHA1) algorithm from those accepted for certificate signatures
   (i.e. the client and server CASignatureAlgorithms option) and will
   use the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm by default when the
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> CA signs new certificates.

   Certificates are at special risk to the aforementioned SHA1
   collision vulnerability as an attacker has effectively unlimited
   time in which to craft a collision that yields them a valid
   certificate, far more than the relatively brief LoginGraceTime
   window that they have to forge a host key signature.

   The OpenSSH certificate format includes a CA-specified (typically
   random) nonce value near the start of the certificate that should
   make exploitation of chosen-prefix collisions in this context
   challenging, as the attacker does not have full control over the
   prefix that actually gets signed. Nonetheless, SHA1 is now a
   demonstrably broken algorithm and futher improvements in attacks
   are highly likely.

   OpenSSH releases prior to 7.2 do not support the newer RSA/SHA2
   algorithms and will refuse to accept certificates signed by an
   OpenSSH 8.2+ CA using RSA keys unless the unsafe algorithm is
   explicitly selected during signing ("ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa").
   Older clients/servers may use another CA key type such as
   ssh-ed25519 (supported since OpenSSH 6.5) or one of the
   ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521 types (supported since OpenSSH 5.7)
   instead if they cannot be upgraded.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: the above removal of "ssh-rsa" from the accepted
   CASignatureAlgorithms list.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: this release removes diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
   from the default key exchange proposal for both the client and
   server.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: the command-line options related to the generation
   and screening of safe prime numbers used by the
   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-* key exchange algorithms have
   changed. Most options have been folded under the -O flag.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: the sshd listener process title visible to ps(1) has
   changed to include information about the number of connections that
   are currently attempting authentication and the limits configured
   by MaxStartups.

 * ssh-sk-helper(8): this is a new binary. It is used by the FIDO/U2F
   support to provide address-space isolation for token middleware
   libraries (including the internal one). It needs to be installed
   in the expected path, typically under /usr/libexec or similar.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.1
=========================

This release contains some significant new features.

FIDO/U2F Support
----------------

This release adds support for FIDO/U2F hardware authenticators to
OpenSSH. U2F/FIDO are open standards for inexpensive two-factor
authentication hardware that are widely used for website
authentication.  In OpenSSH FIDO devices are supported by new public
key types "ecdsa-sk" and "ed25519-sk", along with corresponding
certificate types.

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> may be used to generate a FIDO token-backed key, after
which they may be used much like any other key type supported by
OpenSSH, so long as the hardware token is attached when the keys are
used. FIDO tokens also generally require the user explicitly authorise
operations by touching or tapping them.

Generating a FIDO key requires the token be attached, and will usually
require the user tap the token to confirm the operation:

  $ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
  Generating public/private ecdsa-sk key pair.
  You may need to touch your security key to authorize key generation.
  Enter file in which to save the key (/home/djm/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk): 
  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
  Enter same passphrase again: 
  Your identification has been saved in /home/djm/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
  Your public key has been saved in /home/djm/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub

This will yield a public and private key-pair. The private key file
should be useless to an attacker who does not have access to the
physical token. After generation, this key may be used like any other
supported key in OpenSSH and may be listed in authorized_keys, added
to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>, etc. The only additional stipulation is that the FIDO
token that the key belongs to must be attached when the key is used.

FIDO tokens are most commonly connected via USB but may be attached
via other means such as Bluetooth or NFC. In OpenSSH, communication
with the token is managed via a middleware library, specified by the
SecurityKeyProvider directive in ssh/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> or the
$SSH_SK_PROVIDER environment variable for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>. The API for this middleware is documented in the sk-api.h
and PROTOCOL.u2f files in the source distribution.

OpenSSH includes a middleware ("SecurityKeyProvider=internal") with
support for USB tokens. It is automatically enabled in OpenBSD and may
be enabled in portable OpenSSH via the configure flag
--with-security-key-builtin. If the internal middleware is enabled
then it is automatically used by default. This internal middleware
requires that libfido2 (<a href="https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2">https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2</a>)and its
dependencies be installed. We recommend that packagers of portable
OpenSSH enable the built-in middleware, as it provides the
lowest-friction experience for users.

Note: FIDO/U2F tokens are required to implement the ECDSA-P256
"ecdsa-sk" key type, but hardware support for Ed25519 "ed25519-sk" is
less common. Similarly, not all hardware tokens support some of the
optional features such as resident keys.

The protocol-level changes to support FIDO/U2F keys in SSH are
documented in the PROTOCOL.u2f file in the OpenSSH source
distribution.

There are a number of supporting changes to this feature:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: add a "no-touch-required" option when generating
   FIDO-hosted keys, that disables their default behaviour of
   requiring a physical touch/tap on the token during authentication.
   Note: not all tokens support disabling the touch requirement.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a sshd_config PubkeyAuthOptions directive that
   collects miscellaneous public key authentication-related options
   for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>. At present it supports only a single option
   "no-touch-required". This causes sshd to skip its default check for
   FIDO/U2F keys that the signature was authorised by a touch or press
   event on the token hardware.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: add a "no-touch-required" option
   for authorized_keys and a similar extension for certificates. This
   option disables the default requirement that FIDO key signatures
   attest that the user touched their key to authorize them, mirroring
   the similar PubkeyAuthOptions sshd_config option.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: add support for the writing the FIDO attestation
   information that is returned when new keys are generated via the
   "-O write-attestation=/path" option. FIDO attestation certificates
   may be used to verify that a FIDO key is hosted in trusted
   hardware. OpenSSH does not currently make use of this information,
   beyond optionally writing it to disk.

FIDO2 resident keys
-------------------

FIDO/U2F OpenSSH keys consist of two parts: a "key handle" part stored
in the private key file on disk, and a per-device private key that is
unique to each FIDO/U2F token and that cannot be exported from the
token hardware. These are combined by the hardware at authentication
time to derive the real key that is used to sign authentication
challenges.

For tokens that are required to move between computers, it can be
cumbersome to have to move the private key file first. To avoid this
requirement, tokens implementing the newer FIDO2 standard support
"resident keys", where it is possible to effectively retrieve the key
handle part of the key from the hardware.

OpenSSH supports this feature, allowing resident keys to be generated
using the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> "-O resident" flag. This will produce a
public/private key pair as usual, but it will be possible to retrieve
the private key part from the token later. This may be done using
"ssh-keygen -K", which will download all available resident keys from
the tokens attached to the host and write public/private key files
for them. It is also possible to download and add resident keys
directly to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a> without writing files to the file-system
using "ssh-add -K".

Resident keys are indexed on the token by the application string and
user ID. By default, OpenSSH uses an application string of "ssh:" and
an empty user ID. If multiple resident keys on a single token are
desired then it may be necessary to override one or both of these
defaults using the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> "-O application=" or "-O user="
options. Note: OpenSSH will only download and use resident keys whose
application string begins with "ssh:"

Storing both parts of a key on a FIDO token increases the likelihood
of an attacker being able to use a stolen token device. For this
reason, tokens should enforce PIN authentication before allowing
download of keys, and users should set a PIN on their tokens before
creating any resident keys.

Other New Features
------------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add an Include sshd_config keyword that allows including
   additional configuration files via glob(3) patterns. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2468">bz2468</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: make the LE (low effort) DSCP code point available
   via the IPQoS directive; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2986">bz2986</a>,

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when AddKeysToAgent=yes is set and the key contains no
   comment, add the key to the agent with the key's path as the
   comment. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2564">bz2564</a>
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: expose PKCS#11 key labels and X.509
   subjects as key comments, rather than simply listing the PKCS#11
   provider library path. <a href="https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/138">PR138</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: allow PEM export of DSA and ECDSA keys; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3091">bz3091</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: make zlib compile-time optional, available via the
   Makefile.inc ZLIB flag on OpenBSD or via the --with-zlib configure
   option for OpenSSH portable.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: when clients get denied by MaxStartups, send a
   notification prior to the SSH2 protocol banner according to
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253">RFC4253</a> section 4.2.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: when invoking the $SSH_ASKPASS prompt
   program, pass a hint to the program to describe the type of
   desired prompt.  The possible values are "confirm" (indicating
   that a yes/no confirmation dialog with no text entry should be
   shown), "none" (to indicate an informational message only), or
   blank for the original ssh-askpass behaviour of requesting a
   password/phrase.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow forwarding a different agent socket to the path
   specified by $SSH_AUTH_SOCK, by extending the existing ForwardAgent
   option to accepting an explicit path or the name of an environment
   variable in addition to yes/no.
   
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: add a new signature operations "find-principals" to
   look up the principal associated with a signature from an allowed-
   signers file.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: expose the number of currently-authenticating connections
   along with the MaxStartups limit in the process title visible to
   "ps".

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: make ClientAliveCountMax=0 have sensible semantics: it
   will now disable connection killing entirely rather than the
   current behaviour of instantly killing the connection after the
   first liveness test regardless of success. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2627">bz2627</a>
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: clarify order of AllowUsers / DenyUsers vs AllowGroups /
   DenyGroups in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> manual page. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1690">bz1690</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: better describe HashKnownHosts in the manual page. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2560">bz2560</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: clarify that that permitopen=/PermitOpen do no name or
   address translation in the manual page. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3099">bz3099</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow the UpdateHostKeys feature to function when
   multiple known_hosts files are in use. When updating host keys,
   ssh will now search subsequent known_hosts files, but will add
   updated host keys to the first specified file only. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2738">bz2738</a>
    
 * All: replace all calls to signal(2) with a wrapper around
   sigaction(2). This wrapper blocks all other signals during the
   handler preventing races between handlers, and sets SA_RESTART
   which should reduce the potential for short read/write operations.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: fix a race condition in the SIGCHILD handler that could
   turn in to a kill(-1); <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3084">bz3084</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix a case where valid (but extremely large) SSH channel
   IDs were being incorrectly rejected. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3098">bz3098</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when checking host key fingerprints as answers to new
   hostkey prompts, ignore whitespace surrounding the fingerprint
   itself.

 * All: wait for file descriptors to be readable or writeable during
   non-blocking connect, not just readable. Prevents a timeout when
   the server doesn't immediately send a banner (e.g. multiplexers
   like sslh)
 
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: document the sntrup4591761x25519-sha512@tinyssh.org
   key exchange algorithm. <a href="https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/151">PR151</a>

Portability
-----------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: multiple adjustments to the Linux seccomp sandbox:
   - Non-fatally deny IPC syscalls in sandbox
   - Allow clock_gettime64() in sandbox (MIPS / glibc &gt;= 2.31)
   - Allow clock_nanosleep_time64 in sandbox (ARM) <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3100">bz3100</a>
   - Allow clock_nanosleep() in sandbox (recent glibc) <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3093">bz3093</a>

 * Explicit check for memmem declaration and fix up declaration if the
   system headers lack it. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3102">bz3102</a>

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: when acting as a CA and signing certificates with
   an RSA key, default to using the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm.
   Certificates signed by RSA keys will therefore be incompatible
   with OpenSSH versions prior to 7.2 unless the default is
   overridden (using "ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa -s ...").

Changes since OpenSSH 8.0
=========================

This release is focused on bug-fixing.

New Features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Allow %n to be expanded in ProxyCommand strings

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Allow prepending a list of algorithms to the
   default set by starting the list with the '^' character, E.g.
   "HostKeyAlgorithms ^ssh-ed25519"

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: add an experimental lightweight signature and
   verification ability. Signatures may be made using regular ssh keys
   held on disk or stored in a ssh-agent and verified against an
   authorized_keys-like list of allowed keys. Signatures embed a
   namespace that prevents confusion and attacks between different
   usage domains (e.g. files vs email).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: print key comment when extracting public key from a
   private key.  <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3052">bz#3052</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: accept the verbose flag when searching for host keys
   in known hosts (i.e. "ssh-keygen -vF host") to print the matching
   host's random-art signature too. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3003">bz#3003</a>

 * All: support PKCS8 as an optional format for storage of private
   keys to disk.  The OpenSSH native key format remains the default,
   but PKCS8 is a superior format to PEM if interoperability with
   non-OpenSSH software is required, as it may use a less insecure
   key derivation function than PEM's.

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: if a PKCS#11 token returns no keys then try to login and
   refetch them. Based on patch from Jakub Jelen; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2430">bz#2430</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: produce a useful error message if the user's shell is set
   incorrectly during "match exec" processing. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2791">bz#2791</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: allow the maximum uint32 value for the argument passed

  <pre>OpenSSH 8.0 was released on 2019-04-17. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed

Security
========

This release contains mitigation for a weakness in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> tool
and protocol (CVE-2019-6111): when copying files from a remote system
to a local directory, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> did not verify that the filenames that
the server sent matched those requested by the client. This could
allow a hostile server to create or clobber unexpected local files
with attacker-controlled content.

This release adds client-side checking that the filenames sent from
the server match the command-line request,

The scp protocol is outdated, inflexible and not readily fixed. We
recommend the use of more modern protocols like sftp and rsync for
file transfer instead.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: Relating to the above changes to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>; the scp protocol
   relies on the remote shell for wildcard expansion, so there is no
   infallible way for the client's wildcard matching to perfectly
   reflect the server's. If there is a difference between client and
   server wildcard expansion, the client may refuse files from the
   server. For this reason, we have provided a new "-T" flag to scp
   that disables these client-side checks at the risk of
   reintroducing the attack described above.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Remove support for obsolete "host/port" syntax. Slash-
   separated host/port was added in 2001 as an alternative to
   host:port syntax for the benefit of IPv6 users. These days there
   are establised standards for this like [::1]:22 and the slash
   syntax is easily mistaken for CIDR notation, which OpenSSH
   supports for some things. Remove the slash notation from
   ListenAddress and PermitOpen; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2335">bz#2335</a>

Changes since OpenSSH 7.9
=========================

This release is focused on new features and internal refactoring.

   PKCS#11 tokens.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add experimental quantum-computing resistant
   key exchange method, based on a combination of Streamlined NTRU
   Prime 4591^761 and X25519.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Increase the default RSA key size to 3072 bits,
   following NIST Special Publication 800-57's guidance for a
   128-bit equivalent symmetric security level.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Allow "PKCS11Provider=none" to override later instances of
   the PKCS11Provider directive in ssh_config; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2974">bz#2974</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add a log message for situations where a connection is

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: When prompting whether to record a new host key, accept
   the key fingerprint as a synonym for "yes". This allows the user
   to paste a fingerprint obtained out of band at the prompt and
   have the client do the comparison for you.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: When signing multiple certificates on a single
   command-line invocation, allow automatically incrementing the
   certificate serial number.

   the scp and sftp command-lines.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>, ssh-pkcs11-helper(8), <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: Accept "-v"
   command-line flags to increase the verbosity of output; pass
   verbose flags though to subprocesses, such as ssh-pkcs11-helper
   started from ssh-agent.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: Add a "-T" option to allowing testing whether keys in
   an agent are usable by performing a signature and a verification.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: Add a "lsetstat@openssh.com" protocol extension
   that replicates the functionality of the existing SSH2_FXP_SETSTAT
   operation but does not follow symlinks. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2067">bz#2067</a>

   they do not follow symlinks.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Expose $SSH_CONNECTION in the PAM environment. This makes
   the connection 4-tuple available to PAM modules that wish to use
   it in decision-making. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2741">bz#2741</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add a ssh_config "Match final" predicate Matches in same
   pass as "Match canonical" but doesn't require hostname
   canonicalisation be enabled. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2906">bz#2906</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: Support a prefix of '@' to suppress echo of sftp batch
   commands; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2926">bz#2926</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: When printing certificate contents using
   "ssh-keygen -Lf /path/certificate", include the algorithm that
   the CA used to sign the cert.

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix authentication failures when sshd_config contains
   "AuthenticationMethods any" inside a Match block that overrides
   a more restrictive default.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Avoid sending duplicate keepalives when ClientAliveCount
   is enabled.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix two race conditions related to SIGHUP daemon restart.
   Remnant file descriptors in recently-forked child processes could
   block the parent sshd's attempt to listen(2) to the configured
   addresses. Also, the restarting parent sshd could exit before any
   child processes that were awaiting their re-execution state had
   completed reading it, leaving them in a fallback path.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Fix stdout potentially being redirected to /dev/null when
   ProxyCommand=- was in use.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Avoid sending SIGPIPE to child processes if they attempt
   to write to stderr after their parent processes have exited;
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2071">bz#2071</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Fix bad interaction between the ssh_config ConnectTimeout
   and ConnectionAttempts directives - connection attempts after the
   first were ignoring the requested timeout; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2918">bz#2918</a>

 * ssh-keyscan(1): Return a non-zero exit status if no keys were
   found; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2903">bz#2903</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: Sanitize scp filenames to allow UTF-8 characters without
   terminal control sequences;  <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2434">bz#2434</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix confusion between ClientAliveInterval and time-based
   RekeyLimit that could cause connections to be incorrectly closed.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2757">bz#2757</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: Correct some bugs in PKCS#11 token PIN
   handling at initial token login. The attempt to read the PIN
   could be skipped in some cases, particularly on devices with
   integrated PIN readers. This would lead to an inability to
   retrieve keys from these tokens. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2652">bz#2652</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: Support keys on PKCS#11 tokens that set the
   CKA_ALWAYS_AUTHENTICATE flag by requring a fresh login after the
   C_SignInit operation. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2638">bz#2638</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Improve documentation for ProxyJump/-J, clarifying that
   local configuration does not apply to jump hosts.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Clarify manual - ssh-keygen -e only writes
   public keys, not private.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: be more strict in processing protocol banners,
   allowing \r characters only immediately before \n.

 * Various: fix a number of memory leaks, including <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2942">bz#2942</a> and
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2938">bz#2938</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: fix calculation of initial bandwidth limits.
   Account for bytes written before the timer starts and adjust the
   schedule on which recalculations are performed. Avoids an initial
   burst of traffic and yields more accurate bandwidth limits;
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2927">bz#2927</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Only consider the ext-info-c extension during the initial
   key eschange. It shouldn't be sent in subsequent ones, but if it
   is present we should ignore it. This prevents sshd from sending a
   SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO for REKEX for buggy these clients. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2929">bz#2929</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Clarify manual that ssh-keygen -F (find host in 
   authorized_keys) and -R (remove host from authorized_keys) options
   may accept either a bare hostname or a [hostname]:port combo.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2935">bz#2935</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Don't attempt to connect to empty SSH_AUTH_SOCK; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2936">bz#2936</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Silence error messages when sshd fails to load some of
   the default host keys. Failure to load an explicitly-configured
   hostkey is still an error, and failure to load any host key is
   still fatal. pr/103

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Redirect stderr of ProxyCommands to /dev/null when ssh is
   started with ControlPersist; prevents random ProxyCommand output
   from interfering with session output.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: The ssh client was keeping a redundant ssh-agent socket
   (leftover from authentication) around for the life of the
   connection; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2912">bz#2912</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix bug in HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes and
   PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes options. If only RSA-SHA2 siganture types
   were specified, then authentication would always fail for RSA keys
   as the monitor checks only the base key (not the signature
   algorithm) type against *AcceptedKeyTypes. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2746">bz#2746</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Request correct signature types from ssh-agent when
   certificate keys and RSA-SHA2 signatures are in use.

Portability
-----------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: On Cygwin, run as SYSTEM where possible, using S4U for
   token creation if it supports MsV1_0 S4U Logon.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: On Cygwin, use custom user/group matching code that
   respects the OS' behaviour of case-insensitive matching.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Don't set $MAIL if UsePAM=yes as PAM typically specifies
   the user environment if it's enabled; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2937">bz#2937</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> Cygwin: Change service name to cygsshd to avoid collision
   with Microsoft's OpenSSH port.

 * Allow building against OpenSSL -dev (3.x)

 * Fix a number of build problems against version configurations and
   versions of OpenSSL. Including <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2931">bz#2931</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2921">bz#2921</a>

 * Improve warnings in cygwin service setup. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2922">bz#2922</a>

 * Remove hardcoded service name in cygwin setup. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2922">bz#2922</a>

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: the setting of the new CASignatureAlgorithms
   option (see below) bans the use of DSA keys as certificate
   authorities.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: the authentication success/failure log message has
   changed format slightly. It now includes the certificate
   fingerprint (previously it included only key ID and CA key
   fingerprint).

Changes since OpenSSH 7.8
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

New Features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow most port numbers to be specified using
   service names from getservbyname(3) (typically /etc/services).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow the IdentityAgent configuration directive to accept
   environment variable names. This supports the use of multiple
   agent sockets without needing to use fixed paths.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: support signalling sessions via the SSH protocol.
   A limited subset of signals is supported and only for login or
   command sessions (i.e. not subsystems) that were not subject to
   a forced command via authorized_keys or sshd_config. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424">bz#1424</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: support "ssh -Q sig" to list supported signature options.
   Also "ssh -Q help" to show the full set of supported queries.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a CASignatureAlgorithms option for the
   client and server configs to allow control over which signature
   formats are allowed for CAs to sign certificates. For example,
   this allows banning CAs that sign certificates using the RSA-SHA1
   signature algorithm.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: allow key revocation lists (KRLs) to
   revoke keys specified by SHA256 hash.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: allow creation of key revocation lists directly
   from base64-encoded SHA256 fingerprints. This supports revoking
   keys using only the information contained in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>
   authentication log messages.

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: avoid spurious "invalid format" errors when
   attempting to load PEM private keys while using an incorrect
   passphrase. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2901">bz#2901</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: when a channel closed message is received from a client,
   close the stderr file descriptor at the same time stdout is
   closed. This avoids stuck processes if they were waiting for
   stderr to close and were insensitive to stdin/out closing. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2863">bz#2863</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow ForwardX11Timeout=0 to disable the untrusted X11
   forwarding timeout and support X11 forwarding indefinitely.
   Previously the behaviour of ForwardX11Timeout=0 was undefined.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: when compiled with GSSAPI support, cache supported method
   OIDs regardless of whether GSSAPI authentication is enabled in the
   main section of sshd_config. This avoids sandbox violations if
   GSSAPI authentication was later enabled in a Match block. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2107">bz#2107</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: do not fail closed when configured with a text key
   revocation list that contains a too-short key. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2897">bz#2897</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: treat connections with ProxyJump specified the same as
   ones with a ProxyCommand set with regards to hostname
   canonicalisation (i.e. don't try to canonicalise the hostname
   unless CanonicalizeHostname is set to 'always'). <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2896">bz#2896</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix regression in OpenSSH 7.8 that could prevent public-
   key authentication using certificates hosted in a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>
   or against <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> from OpenSSH &lt;7.8.

Portability
-----------

 * All: support building against the openssl-1.1 API (releases 1.1.0g
   and later). The openssl-1.0 API will remain supported at least
   until OpenSSL terminates security patch support for that API version.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow the futex(2) syscall in the Linux seccomp sandbox;
   apparently required by some glibc/OpenSSL combinations.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: handle getgrouplist(3) returning more than
   _SC_NGROUPS_MAX groups. Some platforms consider this limit more
   as a guideline.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: write OpenSSH format private keys by default
   instead of using OpenSSL's PEM format. The OpenSSH format,
   supported in OpenSSH releases since 2014 and described in the
   PROTOCOL.key file in the source distribution, offers substantially
   better protection against offline password guessing and supports
   key comments in private keys. If necessary, it is possible to write
   old PEM-style keys by adding "-m PEM" to ssh-keygen's arguments
   when generating or updating a key.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove internal support for S/Key multiple factor
   authentication. S/Key may still be used via PAM or BSD auth.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: remove vestigal support for running <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> as setuid. This
   used to be required for hostbased authentication and the (long
   gone) rhosts-style authentication, but has not been necessary for
   a long time. Attempting to execute ssh as a setuid binary, or with
   uid != effective uid will now yield a fatal error at runtime.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: the semantics of PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes and the similar
   HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes options have changed. These now specify
   signature algorithms that are accepted for their respective
   authentication mechanism, where previously they specified accepted
   key types. This distinction matters when using the RSA/SHA2
   signature algorithms "rsa-sha2-256", "rsa-sha2-512" and their
   certificate counterparts. Configurations that override these
   options but omit these algorithm names may cause unexpected
   authentication failures (no action is required for configurations
   that accept the default for these options).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: the precedence of session environment variables has
   changed. ~/.ssh/environment and environment="..." options in
   authorized_keys files can no longer override SSH_* variables set
   implicitly by sshd.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: the default IPQoS used by ssh/sshd has changed.
   They will now use DSCP AF21 for interactive traffic and CS1 for
   bulk.  For a detailed rationale, please see the commit message:
   <a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/usr.bin/ssh/readconf.c#rev1.284">https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/usr.bin/ssh/readconf.c#rev1.284</a>

Changes since OpenSSH 7.7
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

New Features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add new signature algorithms "rsa-sha2-256-cert-
   v01@openssh.com" and "rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com" to
   explicitly force use of RSA/SHA2 signatures in authentication.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: extend the PermitUserEnvironment option to accept a
   whitelist of environment variable names in addition to global
   "yes" or "no" settings.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a PermitListen directive to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> and a 
   corresponding permitlisten= authorized_keys option that control
   which listen addresses and port numbers may be used by remote
   forwarding (ssh -R ...).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add some countermeasures against timing attacks used for
   account validation/enumeration. sshd will enforce a minimum time
   or each failed authentication attempt consisting of a global 5ms
   minimum plus an additional per-user 0-4ms delay derived from a
   host secret.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a SetEnv directive to allow an administrator to
   explicitly specify environment variables in sshd_config.
   Variables set by SetEnv override the default and client-specified
   environment.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add a SetEnv directive to request that the server sets
   an environment variable in the session. Similar to the existing
   SendEnv option, these variables are set subject to server
   configuration.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow "SendEnv -PATTERN" to clear environment variables
   previously marked for sending to the server. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1285">bz#1285</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: make UID available as a %-expansion everywhere
   that the username is available currently. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2870">bz#2870</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow setting ProxyJump=none to disable ProxyJump
   functionality. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2869">bz#2869</a>

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: avoid observable differences in request parsing that could
   be used to determine whether a target user is valid.

 * all: substantial internal refactoring

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix some memory leaks; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2366">bz#2366</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix a pwent clobber (introduced in openssh-7.7) that could
   occur during key loading, manifesting as crash on some platforms.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: clarify documentation for AuthenticationMethods
   option; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2663">bz#2663</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: ensure that the public key algorithm sent in a
   public key SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST matches the content of the
   signature blob. Previously, these could be inconsistent when a
   legacy or non-OpenSSH ssh-agent returned a RSA/SHA1 signature
   when asked to make a RSA/SHA2 signature.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix failures to read authorized_keys caused by faulty
   supplemental group caching. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2873">bz#2873</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: apply umask to directories, fixing potential mkdir/chmod
   race when copying directory trees <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2839">bz#2839</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: return correct exit code when searching for and
   hashing known_hosts entries in a single operation; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2772">bz#2772</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: prefer the ssh binary pointed to via argv[0] to $PATH when
   re-executing ssh for ProxyJump. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2831">bz#2831</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: do not ban PTY allocation when a sshd session is
   restricted because the user password is expired as it breaks
   password change dialog. (regression in openssh-7.7).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix error reporting from select() failures. 

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: improve documentation for -w (tunnel) flag, emphasising
   that -w implicitly sets Tunnel=point-to-point. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2365">bz#2365</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: implement EMFILE mitigation for ssh-agent. ssh-agent
   will no longer spin when its file descriptor limit is exceeded.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2576">bz#2576</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: disable SSH2_MSG_DEBUG messages for Twisted Conch
   clients. Twisted Conch versions that lack a version number in
   their identification strings will mishandle these messages when
   running on Python 2.x (<a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9422">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9422</a>)
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: notify user immediately when underlying ssh process dies
   expectedly. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2719">bz#2719</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix tunnel forwarding; regression in 7.7 release.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2855">bz#2855</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: don't kill ssh-agent's listening socket entirely if
   it fails to accept(2) a connection. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2837">bz#2837</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: relax checking of authorized_keys environment="..."
   options to allow underscores in variable names (regression
   introduced in 7.7). <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2851">bz#2851</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add some missing options in the configuration dump output
   (ssh -G). <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2835">bz#2835</a>

Portability
-----------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Expose details of completed authentication to PAM auth
   modules via SSH_AUTH_INFO_0 in the PAM environment. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2408">bz#2408</a>

 * Fix compilation problems caused by fights between zlib and OpenSSL
   colliding uses of "free_func"

 * Improve detection of unsupported compiler options. Recently these
   may have manifested as "unsupported -Wl,-z,retpoline" warnings
   during linking.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: some sandbox support for Linux/s390 <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2752">bz#2752</a>.

 * regress tests: unbreak key-options.sh test on platforms without
   openpty(3). <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2856">bz#2856</a>

 * use getrandom(2) for PRNG seeding when built without OpenSSL.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Drop compatibility support for some very old SSH
   implementations, including ssh.com &lt;=2.* and OpenSSH &lt;= 3.*. These
   versions were all released in or before 2001 and predate the final
   SSH RFCs. The support in question isn't necessary for RFC-compliant
   SSH implementations.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.6
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

New Features
------------

 * All: Add experimental support for PQC XMSS keys (Extended Hash-
   Based Signatures) based on the algorithm described in
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xmss-hash-based-signatures-12">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xmss-hash-based-signatures-12</a>
   The XMSS signature code is experimental and not compiled in by
   default.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add a "rdomain" criteria for the sshd_config Match keyword
   to allow conditional configuration that depends on which routing
   domain a connection was received on (currently supported on OpenBSD
   and Linux).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: Add an optional rdomain qualifier to the
   ListenAddress directive to allow listening on different routing
   domains. This is supported only on OpenBSD and Linux at present.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: Add RDomain directive to allow the authenticated
   session to be placed in an explicit routing domain. This is only
   supported on OpenBSD at present.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add "expiry-time" option for authorized_keys files to
   allow for expiring keys.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add a BindInterface option to allow binding the outgoing
   connection to an interface's address (basically a more usable
   BindAddress)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Expose device allocated for tun/tap forwarding via a new
   %T expansion for LocalCommand. This allows LocalCommand to be used
   to prepare the interface.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Expose the device allocated for tun/tap forwarding via a
   new SSH_TUNNEL environment variable. This allows automatic setup of
   the interface and surrounding network configuration automatically on
   the server.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: Add URI support to ssh, sftp and scp, e.g.
   ssh://user@host or sftp://user@host/path.  Additional connection
   parameters described in draft-ietf-secsh-scp-sftp-ssh-uri-04 are not
   implemented since the ssh fingerprint format in the draft uses the
   deprecated MD5 hash with no way to specify the any other algorithm.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Allow certificate validity intervals that specify
   only a start or stop time (instead of both or neither).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: Allow "cd" and "lcd" commands with no explicit path
   argument. lcd will change to the local user's home directory as
   usual. cd will change to the starting directory for session (because
   the protocol offers no way to obtain the remote user's home
   directory). <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2760">bz#2760</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: When doing a config test with sshd -T, only require the
   attributes that are actually used in Match criteria rather than (an
   incomplete list of) all criteria.

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: More strictly check signature types during key
   exchange against what was negotiated. Prevents downgrade of RSA
   signatures made with SHA-256/512 to SHA-1.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix support for client that advertise a protocol version
   of "1.99" (indicating that they are prepared to accept both SSHv1 and
   SSHv2). This was broken in OpenSSH 7.6 during the removal of SSHv1
   support. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2810">bz#2810</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Warn when the agent returns a ssh-rsa (SHA1) signature when
   a rsa-sha2-256/512 signature was requested. This condition is possible
   when an old or non-OpenSSH agent is in use. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2799">bz#2799</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: Fix regression introduced in 7.6 that caused ssh-agent
   to fatally exit if presented an invalid signature request message.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: Accept yes/no flag options case-insensitively, as
   has been the case in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> for a long time. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2664">bz#2664</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Improve error reporting for failures during connection.
   Under some circumstances misleading errors were being shown. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2814">bz#2814</a>

 * ssh-keyscan(1): Add -D option to allow printing of results directly
   in SSHFP format. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2821">bz#2821</a>

 * regress tests: fix PuTTY interop test broken in last release's SSHv1
   removal. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2823">bz#2823</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Compatibility fix for some servers that erroneously drop the
   connection when the IUTF8 (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8160">RFC8160</a>) option is sent.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: Disable RemoteCommand and RequestTTY in the ssh session
   started by scp (sftp was already doing this.)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Refuse to create a certificate with an unusable
   number of principals.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Fatally exit if ssh-keygen is unable to write all the
   public key during key generation. Previously it would silently
   ignore errors writing the comment and terminating newline.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Do not modify hostname arguments that are addresses by
   automatically forcing them to lower-case. Instead canonicalise them
   to resolve ambiguities (e.g. ::0001 =&gt; ::1) before they are matched
   against known_hosts. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2763">bz#2763</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Don't accept junk after "yes" or "no" responses to hostkey
   prompts. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2803">bz#2803</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: Have sftp print a warning about shell cleanliness when
   decoding the first packet fails, which is usually caused by shells
   polluting stdout of non-interactive startups. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2800">bz#2800</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Switch timers in packet code from using wall-clock
   time to monotonic time, allowing the packet layer to better function
   over a clock step and avoiding possible integer overflows during
   steps.

 * Numerous manual page fixes and improvements.

Portability
-----------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Correctly detect MIPS ABI in use at configure time. Fixes
   sandbox violations on some environments.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Remove UNICOS support. The hardware and software are literal
   museum pieces and support in sshd is too intrusive to justify
   maintaining.

 * All: Build and link with "retpoline" flags when available to mitigate
   the "branch target injection" style (variant 2) of the Spectre
   branch-prediction vulnerability.

 * All: Add auto-generated dependency information to Makefile.

 * Numerous fixed to the RPM spec files.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: delete SSH protocol version 1 support, associated
   configuration options and documentation.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove support for the hmac-ripemd160 MAC.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove support for the arcfour, blowfish and CAST

 * Refuse RSA keys &lt;1024 bits in length and improve reporting for keys
   that do not meet this requirement.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: do not offer CBC ciphers by default.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.5
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release. It also contains substantial
internal refactoring.

Security
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: in read-only mode, sftp-server was incorrectly
   permitting creation of zero-length files. Reported by Michal
   Zalewski.

New Features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add RemoteCommand option to specify a command in the ssh
   config file instead of giving it on the client's command line. This
   allows the configuration file to specify the command that will be
   executed on the remote host.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add ExposeAuthInfo option that enables writing details of
   the authentication methods used (including public keys where
   applicable) to a file that is exposed via a $SSH_USER_AUTH
   environment variable in the subsequent session.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add support for reverse dynamic forwarding. In this mode,
   ssh will act as a SOCKS4/5 proxy and forward connections
   to destinations requested by the remote SOCKS client. This mode
   is requested using extended syntax for the -R and RemoteForward
   options and, because it is implemented solely at the client,
   does not require the server be updated to be supported.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow LogLevel directive in sshd_config Match blocks;
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2717">bz#2717</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: allow inclusion of arbitrary string or flag
   certificate extensions and critical options.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: allow ssh-keygen to use a key held in ssh-agent as
   a CA when signing certificates. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2377">bz#2377</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow IPQoS=none in ssh/sshd to not set an explicit
   ToS/DSCP value and just use the operating system default.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: added -q option to make ssh-add quiet on success.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: expand the StrictHostKeyChecking option with two new
   settings. The first "accept-new" will automatically accept
   hitherto-unseen keys but will refuse connections for changed or
   invalid hostkeys. This is a safer subset of the current behaviour
   of StrictHostKeyChecking=no. The second setting "off", is a synonym
   for the current behaviour of StrictHostKeyChecking=no: accept new
   host keys, and continue connection for hosts with incorrect
   hostkeys. A future release will change the meaning of
   StrictHostKeyChecking=no to the behaviour of "accept-new". <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2400">bz#2400</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add SyslogFacility option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> matching the equivalent
   option in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2705">bz#2705</a>

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: use HostKeyAlias if specified instead of hostname for
   matching host certificate principal names; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2728">bz#2728</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: implement sorting for globbed ls; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2649">bz#2649</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add a user@host prefix to client's "Permission denied"
   messages, useful in particular when using "stacked" connections
   (e.g. ssh -J) where it's not clear which host is denying. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2720">bz#2720</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: accept unknown EXT_INFO extension values that contain \0
   characters. These are legal, but would previously cause fatal
   connection errors if received.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: repair compression statistics printed at
   connection exit

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: print '?' instead of incorrect link count (that the
   protocol doesn't provide) for remote listings. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2710">bz#2710</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: return failure rather than fatal() for more cases during
   session multiplexing negotiations. Causes the session to fall back
   to a non-mux connection if they occur. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2707">bz#2707</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: mention that the server may send debug messages to explain
   public key authentication problems under some circumstances; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2709">bz#2709</a>

 * Translate OpenSSL error codes to better report incorrect passphrase
   errors when loading private keys; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2699">bz#2699</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: adjust compatibility patterns for WinSCP to correctly
   identify versions that implement only the legacy DH group exchange
   scheme. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2748">bz#2748</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: print the "Killed by signal 1" message only at LogLevel
   verbose so that it is not shown at the default level; prevents it
   from appearing during ssh -J and equivalent ProxyCommand configs.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1906">bz#1906</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2744">bz#2744</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: when generating all hostkeys (ssh-keygen -A), clobber
   existing keys if they exist but are zero length. zero-length keys
   could previously be made if ssh-keygen failed or was interrupted part
   way through generating them. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2561">bz#2561</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix pledge(2) violation in the escape sequence "~&amp;" used to
   place the current session in the background.

 * ssh-keyscan(1): avoid double-close() on file descriptors; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2734">bz#2734</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: avoid reliance on shared use of pointers shared between
   monitor and child sshd processes. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2704">bz#2704</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.8">sshd_config(8)</a>: document available AuthenticationMethods; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2453">bz#2453</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: avoid truncation in some login prompts; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2768">bz#2768</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix various compilations failures, inc <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2767">bz#2767</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: make "--" before the hostname terminate argument processing
   after the hostname too.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: switch from aes256-cbc to aes256-ctr for encrypting
   new-style private keys. Fixes problems related to private key
   handling for no-OpenSSL builds. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2754">bz#2754</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: warn and do not attempt to use keys when the public and
   private halves do not match. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2737">bz#2737</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: don't print verbose error message when ssh disconnects
   from under sftp. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2750">bz#2750</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix keepalive scheduling problem: activity on a forwarded
   port from preventing the keepalive from being sent; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2756">bz#2756</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: when started without root privileges, don't require the
   privilege separation user or path to exist. Makes running the
   regression tests easier without touching the filesystem.

 * Make integrity.sh regression tests more robust against timeouts.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2658">bz#2658</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: correctness fix for channels implementation: accept
   channel IDs greater than 0x7FFFFFFF.

Portability
-----------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.9">sshd(9)</a>: drop two more privileges in the Solaris sandbox:
   PRIV_DAX_ACCESS and PRIV_SYS_IB_INFO; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2723">bz#2723</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: expose list of completed authentication methods to PAM
   via the SSH_AUTH_INFO_0 PAM environment variable. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2408">bz#2408</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix several problems in the tun/tap forwarding code,
   mostly to do with host/network byte order confusion. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2735">bz#2735</a>

 * Add --with-cflags-after and --with-ldflags-after configure flags to
   allow setting CFLAGS/LDFLAGS after configure has completed. These
   are useful for setting sanitiser/fuzzing options that may interfere
   with configure's operation.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: avoid Linux seccomp violations on ppc64le over the
   socketcall syscall.

 * Fix use of ldns when using ldns-config; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2697">bz#2697</a>

 * configure: set cache variables when cross-compiling. The cross-
   compiling fallback message was saying it assumed the test passed,
   but it wasn't actually set the cache variables and this would
   cause later tests to fail.

 * Add clang libFuzzer harnesses for public key parsing and signature
   verification.

  <pre>OpenSSH 7.5 was released on 2017-03-20. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<a href="http://www.openssh.com/donations.html">http://www.openssh.com/donations.html</a>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:

 * In the next major release (expected June-August), removing remaining
   support for the SSH v.1 protocol (currently client-only and compile-
   time disabled).

 * In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
   and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).

 * In the same release, removing the remaining CBC ciphers from being
   offered by default in the client (These have not been offered in
   sshd by default for several years).

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * This release deprecates the sshd_config UsePrivilegeSeparation
   option, thereby making privilege separation mandatory. Privilege
   separation has been on by default for almost 15 years and
   sandboxing has been on by default for almost the last five.

 * The format of several log messages emitted by the packet code has
   changed to include additional information about the user and
   their authentication state. Software that monitors ssh/sshd logs
   may need to account for these changes. For example:

   Connection closed by user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
   Connection closed by authenticating user x 10.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
   Connection closed by invalid user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]

   Affected messages include connection closure, timeout, remote
   disconnection, negotiation failure and some other fatal messages
   generated by the packet code.

 * [Portable OpenSSH only] This version removes support for building
   against OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1. OpenSSL stopped supporting
   versions prior to 1.0.1 over 12 months ago (i.e. they no longer
   receive fixes for security bugs).

Changes since OpenSSH 7.4
=========================

This is a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix weakness in CBC padding oracle countermeasures
   that allowed a variant of the attack fixed in OpenSSH 7.3 to proceed.
   Note that the OpenSSH client disables CBC ciphers by default, sshd
   offers them as lowest-preference options and will remove them by
   default entriely in the next release. Reported by Jean Paul
   Degabriele, Kenny Paterson, Martin Albrecht and Torben Hansen of
   Royal Holloway, University of London.

 * sftp-client(1): [portable OpenSSH only] On Cygwin, a client making
   a recursive file transfer could be maniuplated by a hostile server to
   perform a path-traversal attack. creating or modifying files outside
   of the intended target directory. Reported by Jann Horn of Google
   Project Zero.

   error messages from ssh-keyscan <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2583">bz#2583</a> and a segfault in sshd
   if protocol v.1 was enabled for the client and sshd_config
   contained references to legacy keys <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2686">bz#2686</a>.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Free fd_set on connection timeout. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2683">bz#2683</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Sanitise escape sequences in key comments sent to
   printf but preserve valid UTF-8 when the locale supports it;
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2520">bz#2520</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Return reason for port forwarding failures where

  <h3><a href="txt/release-7.4" id="7.4">OpenSSH 7.4</a>/<a href="txt/release-7.4" id="7.4p1">7.4p1</a> (2016-12-19)</h3> 
  <pre>OpenSSH 7.4 was released on 2016-12-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<a href="http://www.openssh.com/donations.html">http://www.openssh.com/donations.html</a>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:

 * In approximately August 2017, removing remaining support for the
   SSH v.1 protocol (client-only and currently compile-time disabled).

 * In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
   and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

 * The next release of OpenSSH will remove support for running <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>
   with privilege separation disabled.

 * The next release of portable OpenSSH will remove support for
   OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1.

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * This release removes server support for the SSH v.1 protocol.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Remove 3des-cbc from the client's default proposal. 64-bit
   block ciphers are not safe in 2016 and we don't want to wait until
   attacks like SWEET32 are extended to SSH. As 3des-cbc was the
   only mandatory cipher in the SSH RFCs, this may cause problems
   connecting to older devices using the default configuration,
   but it's highly likely that such devices already need explicit
   configuration for key exchange and hostkey algorithms already
   anyway.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Remove support for pre-authentication compression.
   Doing compression early in the protocol probably seemed reasonable
   in the 1990s, but today it's clearly a bad idea in terms of both
   cryptography (cf. multiple compression oracle attacks in TLS) and
   attack surface. Pre-auth compression support has been disabled by
   default for &gt;10 years. Support remains in the client.
    
 * ssh-agent will refuse to load PKCS#11 modules outside a whitelist
   of trusted paths by default. The path whitelist may be specified
   at run-time.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: When a forced-command appears in both a certificate and
   an authorized keys/principals command= restriction, sshd will now
   refuse to accept the certificate unless they are identical.
   The previous (documented) behaviour of having the certificate
   forced-command override the other could be a bit confusing and
   error-prone.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Remove the UseLogin configuration directive and support
   for having /bin/login manage login sessions.
    
Changes since OpenSSH 7.3
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths
   outside a trusted whitelist (run-time configurable). Requests to
   load modules could be passed via agent forwarding and an attacker
   could attempt to load a hostile PKCS#11 module across the forwarded
   agent channel: PKCS#11 modules are shared libraries, so this would
   result in code execution on the system running the ssh-agent if the
   attacker has control of the forwarded agent-socket (on the host
   running the sshd server) and the ability to write to the filesystem
   of the host running ssh-agent (usually the host running the ssh
   client). Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-
   domain sockets would be created by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> with the privileges of
   'root' instead of the authenticated user. This release refuses
   Unix-domain socket forwarding when privilege separation is disabled
   (Privilege separation has been enabled by default for 14 years).
   Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
   privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when reading
   keys. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys,
   nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material
   to unprivileged users. Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
 
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication
   compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by
   some optimising compilers. Additionally, this memory manager was
   incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication compression was
   disabled. This could potentially allow attacks against the
   privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation
   process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).
   This release removes support for pre-authentication compression
   from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>. Reported by Guido Vranken using the Stack unstable
   optimisation identification tool (<a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/">http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/</a>)
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix denial-of-service condition where an attacker who
   sends multiple KEXINIT messages may consume up to 128MB per
   connection. Reported by Shi Lei of Gear Team, Qihoo 360.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers
   directives at configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid
   ones. It was previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address
   ranges (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match,
   possibly resulting in granting access where it was not intended.
   Reported by Laurence Parry.

New Features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add a proxy multiplexing mode to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> inspired by the
   version in PuTTY by Simon Tatham. This allows a multiplexing
   client to communicate with the master process using a subset of
   the SSH packet and channels protocol over a Unix-domain socket,
   with the main process acting as a proxy that translates channel
   IDs, etc.  This allows multiplexing mode to run on systems that
   lack file- descriptor passing (used by current multiplexing
   code) and potentially, in conjunction with Unix-domain socket
   forwarding, with the client and multiplexing master process on
   different machines. Multiplexing proxy mode may be invoked using
   "ssh -O proxy ..."

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add a sshd_config DisableForwarding option that disables
   X11, agent, TCP, tunnel and Unix domain socket forwarding, as well
   as anything else we might implement in the future. Like the
   'restrict' authorized_keys flag, this is intended to be a simple
   and future-proof way of restricting an account.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Support the "curve25519-sha256" key exchange
   method. This is identical to the currently-supported method named
   "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org".

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Improve handling of SIGHUP by checking to see if sshd is
   already daemonised at startup and skipping the call to daemon(3)
   if it is. This ensures that a SIGHUP restart of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> will
   retain the same process-ID as the initial execution. <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> will
   also now unlink the PidFile prior to SIGHUP restart and re-create
   it after a successful restart, rather than leaving a stale file in
   the case of a configuration error. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2641">bz#2641</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Allow ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax
   directives to appear in sshd_config Match blocks.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add %-escapes to AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand to match
   those supported by AuthorizedKeysCommand (key, key type,
   fingerprint, etc.) and a few more to provide access to the
   contents of the certificate being offered.

 * Added regression tests for string matching, address matching and
   string sanitisation functions.

 * Improved the key exchange fuzzer harness.
 
Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Allow IdentityFile to successfully load and use
   certificates that have no corresponding bare public key. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2617">bz#2617</a>
   certificate id_rsa-cert.pub (and no id_rsa.pub).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Fix public key authentication when multiple

   keys from PKCS#11 tokens with fewer useless log messages and more
   detail in debug messages. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2610">bz#2610</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: When tearing down ControlMaster connections, don't
   pollute stderr when LogLevel=quiet.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: On ^Z wait for underlying <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> to suspend before
   suspending <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> to ensure that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> restores the terminal mode
   correctly if suspended during a password prompt.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Avoid busy-wait when <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> is suspended during a password
   prompt.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Correctly report errors during sending of ext-
   info messages.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix NULL-deref crash if <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> received an out-of-

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: more strictly enforce the expected ordering of privilege
   separation monitor calls used for authentication and allow them
   only when their respective authentication methods are enabled
   in the configuration

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix uninitialised optlen in getsockopt() call; harmless
   on Unix/BSD but potentially crashy on Cygwin.

 * Fix false positive reports caused by explicit_bzero(3) not being
   recognised as a memory initialiser when compiled with
   -fsanitize-memory.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: Use 2001:db8::/32, the official IPv6 subnet for
   configuration examples.

Portability
-----------

 * On environments configured with Turkish locales, fall back to the
   C/POSIX locale to avoid errors in configuration parsing caused by
   that locale's unique handling of the letters 'i' and 'I'. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2643">bz#2643</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: Deny ptrace on OS X using
   ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH, ..)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Unbreak AES-CTR ciphers on old (~0.9.8) OpenSSL.

 * Fix compilation for libcrypto compiled without RIPEMD160 support.

 * contrib: Add a gnome-ssh-askpass3 with GTK+3 support. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2640">bz#2640</a>
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Improve PRNG reseeding across privilege separation and
   force libcrypto to obtain a high-quality seed before chroot or
   sandboxing.

 * All: Explicitly test for broken strnvis. NetBSD added an strnvis
   and unfortunately made it incompatible with the existing one in
   OpenBSD and Linux's libbsd (the former having existed for over ten
   years). Try to detect this mess, and assume the only safe option
   if we're cross compiling.

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in a near-future
release, specifically:

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)
 * Removing server-side support for the SSH v.1 protocol (currently
   compile-time disabled).
 * In approximately 1 year, removing all support for the SSH v.1
   protocol (currently compile-time disabled).

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.2
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack against
   the system's crypt(3) function via <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>. An attacker could
   send very long passwords that would cause excessive CPU use in
   crypt(3). <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now refuses to accept password authentication
   requests of length greater than 1024 characters. Independently
   reported by Tomas Kuthan (Oracle), Andres Rojas and Javier Nieto.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Mitigate timing differences in password authentication
   that could be used to discern valid from invalid account names
   when long passwords were sent and particular password hashing
   algorithms are in use on the server. CVE-2016-6210, reported by
   EddieEzra.Harari at verint.com

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix observable timing weakness in the CBC padding
   oracle countermeasures. Reported by Jean Paul Degabriele, Kenny
   Paterson, Torben Hansen and Martin Albrecht. Note that CBC ciphers
   are disabled by default and only included for legacy compatibility.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Improve operation ordering of MAC verification for
   Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) mode transport MAC algorithms to verify the
   MAC before decrypting any ciphertext. This removes the possibility
   of timing differences leaking facts about the plaintext, though no
   such leakage has been observed.  Reported by Jean Paul Degabriele,
   Kenny Paterson, Torben Hansen and Martin Albrecht.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: (portable only) Ignore PAM environment vars when
   UseLogin=yes. If PAM is configured to read user-specified
   environment variables and UseLogin=yes in sshd_config, then a
   hostile local user may attack /bin/login via LD_PRELOAD or
   similar environment variables set via PAM. CVE-2015-8325,
   found by Shayan Sadigh.

New Features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add a ProxyJump option and corresponding -J command-line
   flag to allow simplified indirection through a one or more SSH
   bastions or "jump hosts".

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add an IdentityAgent option to allow specifying specific
   agent sockets instead of accepting one from the environment.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Allow ExitOnForwardFailure and ClearAllForwardings to be
   optionally overridden when using ssh -W. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2577">bz#2577</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Implement support for the IUTF8 terminal mode as
   per draft-sgtatham-secsh-iutf8-00.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add support for additional fixed Diffie-Hellman
   2K, 4K and 8K groups from draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-kex-sha2-03.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: support SHA256 and SHA512 RSA
   signatures in certificates;
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add an Include directive for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> files.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Permit UTF-8 characters in pre-authentication banners sent
   from the server. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2058">bz#2058</a>

   protocol events from LOG_CRIT. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2585">bz#2585</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Refuse AuthenticationMethods="" in configurations and
   accept AuthenticationMethods=any for the default behaviour of not
   requiring multiple authentication. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2398">bz#2398</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Remove obsolete and misleading "POSSIBLE BREAK-IN

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Deduplicate LocalForward and RemoteForward entries to fix
   failures when both ExitOnForwardFailure and hostname
   canonicalisation are enabled. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2562">bz#2562</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Remove fallback from moduli to obsolete "primes" file
   that was deprecated in 2001. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2559">bz#2559</a>.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: Correct description of UseDNS: it affects ssh
   hostname processing for authorized_keys, not known_hosts; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2554">bz#2554</a>
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Fix authentication using lone certificate keys in an agent
   without corresponding private keys on the filesystem. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2550">bz#2550</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Send ClientAliveInterval pings when a time-based

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in a near-future
release, specifically:

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release disables a number of legacy cryptographic algorithms
by default in ssh:

 * Several ciphers blowfish-cbc, cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants
   and the rijndael-cbc aliases for AES.

 * MD5-based and truncated HMAC algorithms.

These algorithms are already disabled by default in sshd.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.1p2
===========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove unfinished and unused roaming code (was
   already forcibly disabled in OpenSSH 7.1p2).
 
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: eliminate fallback from untrusted X11 forwarding to
   trusted forwarding when the X server disables the SECURITY
   extension.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: increase the minimum modulus size supported for
   diffie-hellman-group-exchange to 2048 bits.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: pre-auth sandboxing is now enabled by default (previous
   releases enabled it for new installations via sshd_config).

New Features
------------

 * all: add support for RSA signatures using SHA-256/512 hash
   algorithms based on draft-rsa-dsa-sha2-256-03.txt and
   draft-ssh-ext-info-04.txt.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add an AddKeysToAgent client option which can be set to
   'yes', 'no', 'ask', or 'confirm', and defaults to 'no'.  When
   enabled, a private key that is used during authentication will be
   added to ssh-agent if it is running (with confirmation enabled if
   set to 'confirm').
 
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a new authorized_keys option "restrict" that includes
   all current and future key restrictions (no-*-forwarding, etc.).
   Also add permissive versions of the existing restrictions, e.g.
   "no-pty" -&gt; "pty". This simplifies the task of setting up
   restricted keys and ensures they are maximally-restricted,
   regardless of any permissions we might implement in the future.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add ssh_config CertificateFile option to explicitly list
   certificates. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2436">bz#2436</a>
 
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: allow ssh-keygen to change the key comment for all
   supported formats.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: allow fingerprinting from standard input, e.g.
   "ssh-keygen -lf -"

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: allow fingerprinting multiple public keys in a
   file, e.g. "ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/authorized_keys" <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1319">bz#1319</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: support "none" as an argument for sshd_config
   Foreground and ChrootDirectory. Useful inside Match blocks to
   override a global default. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2486">bz#2486</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: support multiple certificates (one per line) and
   reading from standard input (using "-f -") for "ssh-keygen -L"
    
 * ssh-keyscan(1): add "ssh-keyscan -c ..." flag to allow fetching
   certificates instead of plain keys.
 
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: better handle anchored FQDNs (e.g. 'cvs.openbsd.org.') in
   hostname canonicalisation - treat them as already canonical and
   remove the trailing '.' before matching ssh_config.

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: existing destination directories should not terminate
   recursive uploads (regression in openssh 6.8) <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2528">bz#2528</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: correctly send back SSH2_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED
   replies to unexpected messages during key exchange. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2949">bz#2949</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: refuse attempts to set ConnectionAttempts=0, which does
   not make sense and would cause ssh to print an uninitialised stack
   variable. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2500">bz#2500</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix errors when attempting to connect to scoped IPv6
   addresses with hostname canonicalisation enabled.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: list a couple more options usable in Match blocks.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2489">bz#2489</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix "PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +..." inside a Match block.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: expand tilde characters in filenames passed to -i options
   before checking whether or not the identity file exists. Avoids
   confusion for cases where shell doesn't expand (e.g. "-i ~/file"
   vs. "-i~/file"). <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2481">bz#2481</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: do not prepend "exec" to the shell command run by "Match
   exec" in a config file, which could cause some commands to fail
   in certain environments. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2471">bz#2471</a>

 * ssh-keyscan(1): fix output for multiple hosts/addrs on one line
   when host hashing or a non standard port is in use <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2479">bz#2479</a>
 
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: skip "Could not chdir to home directory" message when
   ChrootDirectory is active. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2485">bz#2485</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: include PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes in ssh -G config dump.
    
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: avoid changing TunnelForwarding device flags if they are
   already what is needed; makes it possible to use tun/tap

  <h3><a href="txt/release-7.1p2" id="7.1p2">OpenSSH 7.1p2</a> (2016-01-14)</h3> 
  <pre>OpenSSH 7.1p2 was released on 2016-01-14. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<a href="http://www.openssh.com/donations.html">http://www.openssh.com/donations.html</a>

Changes since OpenSSH 7.1p1
===========================

 * SECURITY: <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: The OpenSSH client code between 5.4 and 7.1
   contains experimental support for resuming SSH-connections (roaming).

   The matching server code has never been shipped, but the client
   code was enabled by default and could be tricked by a malicious
   server into leaking client memory to the server, including private
   client user keys.

   The authentication of the server host key prevents exploitation
   by a man-in-the-middle, so this information leak is restricted
   to connections to malicious or compromised servers.

   MITIGATION: For OpenSSH &gt;= 5.4 the vulnerable code in the client
   can be completely disabled by adding 'UseRoaming no' to the gobal
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> file, or to user configuration in ~/.ssh/config,
   or by passing -oUseRoaming=no on the command line.

   PATCH: See below for a patch to disable this feature (Disabling
   Roaming in the Source Code).

   This problem was reported by the Qualys Security Advisory team.

 * SECURITY: Fix an out of-bound read access in the packet handling
   code. Reported by Ben Hawkes.

 * PROTOCOL: Correctly interpret the 'first_kex_follows' option during
   the intial key exchange. Reported by Matt Johnston.

 * Further use of explicit_bzero has been added in various buffer
   handling code paths to guard against compilers aggressively
   doing dead-store removal.

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in the next release
including:

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

 * Several ciphers will be disabled by default: blowfish-cbc,
   cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants and the rijndael-cbc aliases
   for AES.

 * MD5-based HMAC algorithms will be disabled by default.

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for OpenSSH 7.2 when it is released.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.0
=========================

This is a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: OpenSSH 7.0 contained a logic error in PermitRootLogin=
   prohibit-password/without-password that could, depending on
   compile-time configuration, permit password authentication to
   root while preventing other forms of authentication. This problem
   was reported by Mantas Mikulenas.

Changes since OpenSSH 6.9
=========================

This focus of this release is primarily to deprecate weak, legacy
and/or unsafe cryptography.

Security
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 incorrectly set TTYs to be world-
   writable. Local attackers may be able to write arbitrary messages
   to logged-in users, including terminal escape sequences.
   Reported by Nikolay Edigaryev.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a privilege separation
   weakness related to PAM support. Attackers who could successfully
   compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
   execution and who had valid credentials on the host could
   impersonate other users.  Reported by Moritz Jodeit.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a use-after-free bug
   related to PAM support that was reachable by attackers who could
   compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
   execution. Also reported by Moritz Jodeit.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix circumvention of MaxAuthTries using keyboard-
   interactive authentication. By specifying a long, repeating
   keyboard-interactive "devices" string, an attacker could request
   the same authentication method be tried thousands of times in
   a single pass. The LoginGraceTime timeout in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> and any
   authentication failure delays implemented by the authentication
   mechanism itself were still applied. Found by Kingcope.

Potentially-incompatible Changes
--------------------------------

 * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by
   default at compile time.

 * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
   is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using
   the instructions at <a href="http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html">http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html</a>

 * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled
   by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the
   instructions at <a href="http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html">http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html</a>

 * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.

 * The default for the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> PermitRootLogin option has
   changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".

 * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all
   interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,
   hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted
   keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those
   were enabled).

New Features
------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a>: add PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes option to control which
   public key types are available for user authentication.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: add HostKeyAlgorithms option to control which
   public key types are offered for host authentications.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: extend Ciphers, MACs, KexAlgorithms,
   HostKeyAlgorithms, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes and HostbasedKeyTypes
   options to allow appending to the default set of algorithms
   instead of replacing it. Options may now be prefixed with a '+'
   to append to the default, e.g. "HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss".

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: PermitRootLogin now accepts an argument of
   'prohibit-password' as a less-ambiguous synonym of 'without-
   password'.

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add compatability workarounds for Cisco and more
   PuTTY versions. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2424">bz#2424</a>

 * Fix some omissions and errors in the PROTOCOL and PROTOCOL.mux

Future Deprecation Notice
=========================

The 7.0 release of OpenSSH, due for release in late July, will
deprecate several features, some of which may affect compatibility
or existing configurations. The intended changes are as follows:

 * The default for the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> PermitRootLogin option will
   change from "yes" to "no".

 * Support for the legacy version 1.x of the SSH protocol will be
   disabled at compile time by default.

 * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
   will be run-time disabled by default.

 * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys will be
   run-time disabled by default.

 * Support for the legacy v00 cert format will be removed

 * Several ciphers will be disabled by default: blowfish-cbc,
   cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants and the rijndael-cbc aliases
   for AES

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for OpenSSH 7.0 when it is released.

Changes since OpenSSH 6.8
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when forwarding X11 connections with ForwardX11Trusted=no,
   connections made after ForwardX11Timeout expired could be permitted
   and no longer subject to XSECURITY restrictions because of an
   ineffective timeout check in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> coupled with "fail open"
   behaviour in the X11 server when clients attempted connections with
   expired credentials. This problem was reported by Jann Horn.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: fix weakness of agent locking (ssh-add -x) to
   password guessing by implementing an increasing failure delay,
   storing a salted hash of the password rather than the password
   itself and using a timing-safe comparison function for verifying
   unlock attempts. This problem was reported by Ryan Castellucci.

   enabling debug mode; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2381">bz#2381</a>

Bugfixes
--------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: deprecate legacy SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST_OLD

Changes since OpenSSH 6.7
=========================

This is a major release, containing a number of new features as
well as a large internal re-factoring.

Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: UseDNS now defaults to 'no'. Configurations that match
   against the client host name (via sshd_config or authorized_keys)
   may need to re-enable it or convert to matching against addresses.

New Features
------------

 * Much of OpenSSH's internal code has been re-factored to be more
   library-like. These changes are mostly not user-visible, but
   have greatly improved OpenSSH's testability and internal layout.

 * Add FingerprintHash option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, and equivalent
   command-line flags to the other tools to control algorithm used
   for key fingerprints. The default changes from MD5 to SHA256 and
   format from hex to base64.

   Fingerprints now have the hash algorithm prepended. An example of
   the new format: SHA256:mVPwvezndPv/ARoIadVY98vAC0g+P/5633yTC4d/wXE
   Please note that visual host keys will also be different.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Experimental host key rotation support. Add a
   protocol extension for a server to inform a client of all its
   available host keys after authentication has completed. The client
   may record the keys in known_hosts, allowing it to upgrade to better
   host key algorithms and a server to gracefully rotate its keys.

   The client side of this is controlled by a UpdateHostkeys config
   option (default off).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add a ssh_config HostbasedKeyType option to control which
   host public key types are tried during host-based authentication.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix connection-killing host key mismatch errors
   when sshd offers multiple ECDSA keys of different lengths.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when host name canonicalisation is enabled, try to
   parse host names as addresses before looking them up for
   canonicalisation. fixes <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2074">bz#2074</a> and avoiding needless DNS
   lookups in some cases.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Key Revocation Lists (KRLs) no longer
   require OpenSSH to be compiled with OpenSSL support.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, ssh-keysign(8): Make ed25519 keys work for host based
   authentication.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: SSH protocol v.1 workaround for the Meyer, et al,
   Bleichenbacher Side Channel Attack. Fake up a bignum key before
   RSA decryption.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Remember which public keys have been used for
   authentication and refuse to accept previously-used keys.
   This allows AuthenticationMethods=publickey,publickey to require
   that users authenticate using two _different_ public keys.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add sshd_config HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes and
   PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes options to allow sshd to control what
   public key types will be accepted. Currently defaults to all.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Don't count partial authentication success as a failure
   against MaxAuthTries.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add RevokedHostKeys option for the client to allow
   text-file or KRL-based revocation of host keys.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Permit KRLs that revoke certificates by
   serial number or key ID without scoping to a particular CA.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add a "Match canonical" criteria that allows ssh_config
   Match blocks to trigger only in the second config pass.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add a -G option to ssh that causes it to parse its
   configuration and dump the result to stdout, similar to "sshd -T".

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Allow Match criteria to be negated. E.g. "Match !host".

 * The regression test suite has been extended to cover more OpenSSH
   features. The unit tests have been expanded and now cover key
   exchange.

Bugfixes

 * ssh-keyscan(1): ssh-keyscan has been made much more robust again
   servers that hang or violate the SSH protocol.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Fix regression <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2306">bz#2306</a>: Key path names were
   being lost as comment fields.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Allow ssh_config Port options set in the second config
   parse phase to be applied (they were being ignored). <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2286">bz#2286</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Tweak config re-parsing with host canonicalisation - make
   the second pass through the config files always run when host name
   canonicalisation is enabled (and not whenever the host name
   changes) <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2267">bz#2267</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Fix passing of wildcard forward bind addresses when
   connection multiplexing is in use; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2324">bz#2324</a>;

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Fix broken private key conversion from non-OpenSSH
   formats; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2345">bz#2345</a>.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Fix KRL generation bug when multiple CAs are in
   use.

 * Various fixes to manual pages: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2288">bz#2288</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2316">bz#2316</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2273">bz#2273</a>

Portable OpenSSH

 * Support --without-openssl at configure time

   Disables and removes dependency on OpenSSL. Many features,
   including SSH protocol 1 are not supported and the set of crypto
   options is greatly restricted. This will only work on systems
   with native arc4random or /dev/urandom.

   Considered highly experimental for now.

 * Support --without-ssh1 option at configure time

   Allows disabling support for SSH protocol 1.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix compilation on systems with IPv6 support in utmpx; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2296">bz#2296</a>

 * Allow custom service name for sshd on Cygwin. Permits the use of
   multiple sshd running with different service names.

Changes since OpenSSH 6.6
=========================

Potentially-incompatible changes

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: The default set of ciphers and MACs has been altered to
   remove unsafe algorithms. In particular, CBC ciphers and arcfour*
   are disabled by default.

   The full set of algorithms remains available if configured
   explicitly via the Ciphers and MACs sshd_config options.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Support for tcpwrappers/libwrap has been removed.

 * OpenSSH 6.5 and 6.6 have a bug that causes ~0.2% of connections
   using the curve25519-sha256@libssh.org KEX exchange method to fail
   when connecting with something that implements the specification
   correctly. OpenSSH 6.7 disables this KEX method when speaking to
   one of the affected versions.

New Features

 * Major internal refactoring to begin to make part of OpenSSH usable
   as a library. So far the wire parsing, key handling and KRL code
   has been refactored. Please note that we do not consider the API
   stable yet, nor do we offer the library in separable form.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add support for Unix domain socket forwarding.
   A remote TCP port may be forwarded to a local Unix domain socket
   and vice versa or both ends may be a Unix domain socket.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Add support for SSHFP DNS records for
   ED25519 key types.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: Allow resumption of interrupted uploads.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: When rekeying, skip file/DNS lookups of the hostkey if it
   is the same as the one sent during initial key exchange; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2154">bz#2154</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Allow explicit ::1 and 127.0.0.1 forwarding bind
   addresses when GatewayPorts=no; allows client to choose address
   family; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2222">bz#2222</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add a sshd_config PermitUserRC option to control whether
   ~/.ssh/rc is executed, mirroring the no-user-rc authorized_keys
   option; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2160">bz#2160</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add a %C escape sequence for LocalCommand and ControlPath
   that expands to a unique identifer based on a hash of the tuple of
   (local host, remote user, hostname, port). Helps avoid exceeding
   miserly pathname limits for Unix domain sockets in multiplexing
   control paths; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2220">bz#2220</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Make the "Too many authentication failures" message
   include the user, source address, port and protocol in a format
   similar to the authentication success / failure messages; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2199">bz#2199</a>

 * Added unit and fuzz tests for refactored code. These are run
   automatically in portable OpenSSH via the "make tests" target.

Bugfixes

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix remote forwarding with the same listen port but
   different listen address.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Fix inverted test that caused PKCS#11 keys that were
   explicitly listed in ssh_config or on the commandline not to be
   preferred.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Fix bug in KRL generation: multiple consecutive
   revoked certificate serial number ranges could be serialised to an
   invalid format. Readers of a broken KRL caused by this bug will
   fail closed, so no should-have-been-revoked key will be accepted.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Reflect stdio-forward ("ssh -W host:port ...") failures in
   exit status. Previously we were always returning 0; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2255">bz#2255</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Make Ed25519 keys' title fit properly in the
   randomart border; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2247">bz#2247</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: Only cleanup agent socket in the main agent process
   and not in any subprocesses it may have started (e.g. forked
   askpass). Fixes agent sockets being zapped when askpass processes
   fatal(); <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2236">bz#2236</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: Make stdout line-buffered; saves partial output getting
   lost when ssh-add fatal()s part-way through (e.g. when listing keys
   from an agent that supports key types that ssh-add doesn't);
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2234">bz#2234</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: When hashing or removing hosts, don't choke on
   @revoked markers and don't remove @cert-authority markers; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2241">bz#2241</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Don't fatal when hostname canonicalisation fails and a
   ProxyCommand is in use; continue and allow the ProxyCommand to
   connect anyway (e.g. to a host with a name outside the DNS behind
   a bastion)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: When copying local-&gt;remote fails during read, don't send
   uninitialised heap to the remote end.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: Fix fatal "el_insertstr failed" errors when tab-completing
   filenames with  a single quote char somewhere in the string;
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2238">bz#2238</a>

 * ssh-keyscan(1): Scan for Ed25519 keys by default.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: When using VerifyHostKeyDNS with a DNSSEC resolver, down-
   convert any certificate keys to plain keys and attempt SSHFP
   resolution.  Prevents a server from skipping SSHFP lookup and
   forcing a new-hostkey dialog by offering only certificate keys.
     
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Avoid crash at exit via NULL pointer reference; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2225">bz#2225</a>

 * Fix some strict-alignment errors.

Portable OpenSSH

 * Portable OpenSSH now supports building against libressl-portable.

 * Portable OpenSSH now requires openssl 0.9.8f or greater. Older
   versions are no longer supported.

 * In the OpenSSL version check, allow fix version upgrades (but not
   downgrades. Debian bug #748150.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: On Cygwin, determine privilege separation user at runtime,
   since it may need to be a domain account.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Don't attempt to use vhangup on Linux. It doesn't work for
   non-root users, and for them it just messes up the tty settings.

 * Use CLOCK_BOOTTIME in preference to CLOCK_MONOTONIC when it is
   available. It considers time spent suspended, thereby ensuring
   timeouts (e.g. for expiring agent keys) fire correctly.  <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2228">bz#2228</a>

 * Add support for ed25519 to opensshd.init init script.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: On platforms that support it, use prctl() to
   prevent sftp-server from accessing /proc/self/{mem,maps}

Changes since OpenSSH 6.6
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: when using environment passing with a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>
   AcceptEnv pattern with a wildcard. OpenSSH prior to 6.6 could be
   tricked into accepting any enviornment variable that contains the
   characters before the wildcard character.

New / changed features:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: this release removes the J-PAKE authentication code.
   This code was experimental, never enabled and had been unmaintained
   for some time.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when processing Match blocks, skip 'exec' clauses other clauses
   predicates failed to match.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: if hostname canonicalisation is enabled and results in the
   destination hostname being changed, then re-parse <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> files
   using the new destination hostname. This gives 'Host' and 'Match'
   directives that use the expanded hostname a chance to be applied.

Bugfixes:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: avoid spurious "getsockname failed: Bad file descriptor" in
   ssh -W. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2200">bz#2200</a>, debian#738692

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow the shutdown(2) syscall in seccomp-bpf and systrace
   sandbox modes, as it is reachable if the connection is terminated
   during the pre-auth phase.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix unsigned overflow that in SSH protocol 1 bignum
   parsing. Minimum key length checks render this bug unexploitable to
   compromise SSH 1 sessions.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: clarify behaviour of a keyword that appears in
   multiple matching Match blocks. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2184">bz#2184</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: avoid unnecessary hostname lookups when canonicalisation is
   disabled. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2205">bz#2205</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: avoid sandbox violation crashes in GSSAPI code by caching
   the supported list of GSSAPI mechanism OIDs before entering the
   sandbox. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2107">bz#2107</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix possible crashes in SOCKS4 parsing caused by assumption
   that the SOCKS username is nul-terminated.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix regression for UsePrivilegedPort=yes when BindAddress is
   not specified.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix memory leak in ECDSA signature verification.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix matching of 'Host' directives in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> files
   to be case-insensitive again (regression in 6.5).

Portable OpenSSH:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: don't fatal if the FreeBSD Capsicum is offered by the
   system headers and libc but is not supported by the kernel.
 * Fix build using the HP-UX compiler.

  <h3><a href="txt/release-6.5" id="6.5">OpenSSH 6.5</a>/<a href="txt/release-6.5" id="6.5p1">6.5p1</a> (2014-01-30)</h3> 
  <pre>Changes since OpenSSH 6.4
=========================

This is a feature-focused release.

New features:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add support for key exchange using elliptic-curve
   Diffie Hellman in Daniel Bernstein's Curve25519. This key exchange
   method is the default when both the client and server support it.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add support for Ed25519 as a public key type.
   Ed25519 is a elliptic curve signature scheme that offers
   better security than ECDSA and DSA and good performance. It may be
   used for both user and host keys.

 * Add a new private key format that uses a bcrypt KDF to better
   protect keys at rest. This format is used unconditionally for
   Ed25519 keys, but may be requested when generating or saving
   existing keys of other types via the -o <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> option.
   We intend to make the new format the default in the near future.
   Details of the new format are in the PROTOCOL.key file.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add a new transport cipher
   "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com" that combines Daniel Bernstein's
   ChaCha20 stream cipher and Poly1305 MAC to build an authenticated
   encryption mode. Details are in the PROTOCOL.chacha20poly1305 file.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Refuse RSA keys from old proprietary clients and
   servers that use the obsolete RSA+MD5 signature scheme. It will
   still be possible to connect with these clients/servers but only
   DSA keys will be accepted, and OpenSSH will refuse connection
   entirely in a future release.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Refuse old proprietary clients and servers that
   use a weaker key exchange hash calculation.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Increase the size of the Diffie-Hellman groups requested
   for each symmetric key size. New values from NIST Special
   Publication 800-57 with the upper limit specified by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4419">RFC4419</a>.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: Support PKCS#11 tokens that only provide
   X.509 certs instead of raw public keys (requested as <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1908">bz#1908</a>).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> "Match" keyword that allows
   conditional configuration to be applied by matching on hostname,
   user and result of arbitrary commands.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add support for client-side hostname canonicalisation
   using a set of DNS suffixes and rules in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a>. This
   allows unqualified names to be canonicalised to fully-qualified
   domain names to eliminate ambiguity when looking up keys in
   known_hosts or checking host certificate names.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: Add the ability to whitelist and/or blacklist sftp
   protocol requests by name.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: Add a sftp "fsync@openssh.com" to support calling
   fsync(2) on an open file handle.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> PermitTTY to disallow TTY allocation,
   mirroring the longstanding no-pty authorized_keys option.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Add a ssh_config ProxyUseFDPass option that supports the
   use of ProxyCommands that establish a connection and then pass a
   connected file descriptor back to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>. This allows the
   ProxyCommand to exit rather than staying around to transfer data.

Bugfixes:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Fix potential stack exhaustion caused by nested
   certificates.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1211">bz#1211</a>: make BindAddress work with UsePrivilegedPort.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2137">bz#2137</a>: fix the progress meter for resumed transfer.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2187">bz#2187</a>: do not request smartcard PIN when removing
   keys from ssh-agent.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2139">bz#2139</a>: fix re-exec fallback when original sshd binary
   cannot be executed.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Make relative-specified certificate expiry times
   relative to current time and not the validity start time.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2161">bz#2161</a>: fix AuthorizedKeysCommand inside a Match block.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2129">bz#2129</a>: symlinking a file would incorrectly canonicalise
   the target path.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2175">bz#2175</a>: fix a use-after-free in the PKCS#11 agent
   helper executable.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Improve logging of sessions to include the user name,

Portable OpenSSH:

 * Please note that this is the last version of Portable OpenSSH that
   will support versions of OpenSSL prior to 0.9.6. Support (i.e.
   SSH_OLD_EVP) will be removed following the 6.5p1 release.

 * Portable OpenSSH will attempt compile and link as a Position
   Independent Executable on Linux, OS X and OpenBSD on recent gcc-
   like compilers. Other platforms and older/other compilers may
   request this using the --with-pie configure flag.

 * A number of other toolchain-related hardening options are used
   automatically if available, including -ftrapv to abort on signed
   integer overflow and options to write-protect dynamic linking
   information.  The use of these options may be disabled using the
   --without-hardening configure flag.

 * If the toolchain supports it, one of the -fstack-protector-strong,
   -fstack-protector-all or -fstack-protector compilation flag are
   used to add guards to mitigate attacks based on stack overflows.
   The use of these options may be disabled using the
   --without-stackprotect configure option.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Add support for pre-authentication sandboxing using the
   Capsicum API introduced in FreeBSD 10.

 * Switch to a ChaCha20-based arc4random() PRNG for platforms that do
   not provide their own.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2156">bz#2156</a>: restore Linux oom_adj setting when handling
   SIGHUP to maintain behaviour over retart.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2032">bz#2032</a>: use local username in krb5_kuserok check rather
   than full client name which may be of form user@REALM.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Test for both the presence of ECC NID numbers in
   OpenSSL and that they actually work. Fedora (at least) has
   NID_secp521r1 that doesn't work.

 * <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2173">bz#2173</a>: use pkg-config --libs to include correct -L location for
   libedit.

  <pre>Changes since OpenSSH 6.2
=========================

This release is predominantly a bugfix release:

Features:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a> support to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>; allows encrypted hostkeys,
   or hostkeys on smartcards.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow optional time-based rekeying via a second argument

   sshd_config as well as on the client.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: standardise logging of information during user authentication.

   The presented key/cert and the remote username (if available) is now
   logged in the authentication success/failure message on the same log
   line as the local username, remote host/port and protocol in use.
   Certificates contents and the key fingerprint of the signing CA are
   logged too.

   Including all relevant information on a single line simplifies log
   analysis as it is no longer necessary to relate information scattered
   across multiple log entries.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add the ability to query which ciphers, MAC algorithms, key
   types and key exchange methods are supported in the binary.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: support ProxyCommand=- to allow support cases where stdin and
   stdout already point to the proxy.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow IdentityFile=none

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add -E option to ssh and sshd to append debugging logs
   to a specified file instead of stderr or syslog.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: add support for resuming partial downloads using the "reget"
   command and on the sftp commandline or on the "get" commandline using
   the "-a" (append) option.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add an "IgnoreUnknown" configuration option to selectively
   suppress errors arising from unknown configuration directives.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add support for submethods to be appended to required
   authentication methods listed via AuthenticationMethods.

Bugfixes:

   to the CA key appeared in authorized_keys before the CA key.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Use a monotonic time source for timers so
   that things like keepalives and rekeying will work properly over clock
   steps.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: update progressmeter when data is acknowledged, not when it's
   sent. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2108">bz#2108</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: improve error messages when the current user does
   not exist in /etc/passwd; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2125">bz#2125</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: reset the order in which public keys are tried after partial
   authentication success.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: clean up socket files after SIGINT when in debug mode;
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2120">bz#2120</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and others: avoid confusing error messages in the case of broken
   system resolver configurations; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2122">bz#2122</a>

  <pre>
Changes since OpenSSH 6.1
=========================

This release introduces a number of new features:

Features:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Added support for AES-GCM authenticated encryption in
   SSH protocol 2. The new cipher is available as aes128-gcm@openssh.com
   and aes256-gcm@openssh.com. It uses an identical packet format to the
   AES-GCM mode specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5647">RFC 5647</a>, but uses simpler and different
   selection rules during key exchange.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Added support for encrypt-then-mac (EtM) MAC modes
   for SSH protocol 2. These modes alter the packet format and compute
   the MAC over the packet length and encrypted packet rather than over
   the plaintext data. These modes are considered more secure and are
   used by default when available.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Added support for the UMAC-128 MAC as
   "umac-128@openssh.com" and "umac-128-etm@openssh.com". The latter
   being an encrypt-then-mac mode.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Added support for multiple required authentication in SSH
   protocol 2 via an AuthenticationMethods option. This option lists
   one or more comma-separated lists of authentication method names.
   Successful completion of all the methods in any list is required for
   authentication to complete. This allows, for example, requiring a
   user having to authenticate via public key or GSSAPI before they
   are offered password authentication.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Added support for Key Revocation Lists
   (KRLs), a compact binary format to represent lists of revoked keys
   and certificates that take as little as one bit per certificate when
   revoking by serial number. KRLs may be generated using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>
   and are loaded into <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> via the existing RevokedKeys sshd_config
   option.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: IdentitiesOnly now applies to keys obtained from a
   PKCS11Provider. This allows control of which keys are offered from
   tokens using IdentityFile.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>'s AllowTcpForwarding now accepts "local"
   and "remote" in addition to its previous "yes"/"no" keywords to allow
   the server to specify whether just local or remote TCP forwarding is
   enabled.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> option AuthorizedKeysCommand to
   support fetching authorized_keys from a command in addition to (or
   instead of) from the filesystem. The command is run under an account
   specified by an AuthorizedKeysCommandUser <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> option.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: Now supports a -d option to allow the starting
   directory to be something other than the user's home directory.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Now allows fingerprinting of keys hosted in PKCS#11
   tokens using "ssh-keygen -lD pkcs11_provider".

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: When SSH protocol 2 only is selected (the default), <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>
   now immediately sends its SSH protocol banner to the server without
   waiting to receive the server's banner, saving time when connecting.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Added ~v and ~V escape sequences to raise and lower the
   logging level respectively.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Made the escape command help (~?) context sensitive so that
   only commands that will work in the current session are shown.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: When deleting host lines from known_hosts using
   "ssh-keygen -R host", <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> now prints details of which lines
   were removed.
    
Bugfixes:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Force a clean shutdown of ControlMaster client sessions when
   the ~. escape sequence is used. This means that ~. should now work in
   mux clients even if the server is no longer responding.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Correctly detect errors during local TCP forward setup in
   multiplexed clients. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2055">bz#2055</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>: Made deleting explicit keys "ssh-add -d" symmetric with
   adding keys with respect to certificates. It now tries to delete the
   corresponding certificate and respects the -k option to allow deleting
   of the key only.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: Fix a number of parsing and command-editing bugs, including
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1956">bz#1956</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: When muxmaster is run with -N, ensured that it shuts down
   gracefully when a client sends it "-O stop" rather than hanging around.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1985">bz#1985</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: When screening moduli candidates, append to the file
   rather than overwriting to allow resumption. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1957">bz#1957</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Record "Received disconnect" messages at ERROR rather than
   INFO priority. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2057">bz#2057</a>.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Loudly warn if explicitly-provided private key is unreadable.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1981">bz#1981</a>

Portable OpenSSH:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: The Linux seccomp-filter sandbox is now supported on ARM
   platforms where the kernel supports it.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: The seccomp-filter sandbox will not be enabled if the system
   headers support it at compile time, regardless of whether it can be
   enabled then. If the run-time system does not support seccomp-filter,
   sshd will fall back to the rlimit pseudo-sandbox.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Don't link in the Kerberos libraries. They aren't necessary

 * Fix compilation on systems with openssl-1.0.0-fips.

Bugfixes:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: ensure that $DISPLAY contains only valid characters before

Changes since OpenSSH 5.8
=========================

Features:

 * Introduce sandboxing of the pre-auth privsep child using an optional
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> "UsePrivilegeSeparation=sandbox" mode that enables
   mandatory restrictions on the syscalls the privsep child can perform.
   This intention is to prevent a compromised privsep child from being
   used to attack other hosts (by opening sockets and proxying) or
   probing local kernel attack surface.
    
   Three concrete sandbox implementation are provided (selected at
   configure time): systrace, seatbelt and rlimit.

   The systrace sandbox uses systrace(4) in unsupervised "fast-path"
   mode, where a list of permitted syscalls is supplied. Any syscall not
   on the list results in SIGKILL being sent to the privsep child. Note
   that this requires a kernel with the new SYSTR_POLICY_KILL option
   (only OpenBSD has this mode at present).
 
   The seatbelt sandbox uses OS X/Darwin sandbox(7) facilities with a
   strict (kSBXProfilePureComputation) policy that disables access to
   filesystem and network resources.

   The rlimit sandbox is a fallback choice for platforms that don't
   support a better one; it uses setrlimit() to reset the hard-limit
   of file descriptors and processes to zero, which should prevent
   the privsep child from forking or opening new network connections.

   Sandboxing of the privilege separated child process is currently
   experimental but should become the default in a future release.
   Native sandboxes for other platforms are welcome (e.g. Capsicum,
   Linux pid/net namespaces, etc.)

 * Add new SHA256-based HMAC transport integrity modes from
   <a href="http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-dbider-sha2-mac-for-ssh-02.txt">http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-dbider-sha2-mac-for-ssh-02.txt</a>
   These modes are hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-256-96, hmac-sha2-512,
   and hmac-sha2-512-96, and are available by default in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>

 * The pre-authentication <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> privilege separation slave process
   now logs via a socket shared with the master process, avoiding the
   need to maintain /dev/log inside the chroot.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> now warns when a server refuses X11 forwarding

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>'s AuthorizedKeysFile now accepts multiple paths,
   separated by whitespace. The undocumented AuthorizedKeysFile2
   option is deprecated (though the default for AuthorizedKeysFile
   includes .ssh/authorized_keys2)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>: similarly deprecate UserKnownHostsFile2 and
   GlobalKnownHostsFile2 by making UserKnownHostsFile and
   GlobalKnownHostsFile accept multiple options and default to
   include known_hosts2

 * Retain key comments when loading v.2 keys. These will be visible
   in "ssh-add -l" and other places. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=439">bz#439</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: set IPv6 traffic class from IPQoS (as well as
   IPv4 ToS/DSCP). <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1855">bz#1855</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a>'s ControlPath option now expands %L to the host
   portion of the destination host name.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> "Host" options now support negated Host matching, e.g.
     
     Host *.example.org !c.example.org
        User mekmitasdigoat
     
   Will match "a.example.org", "b.example.org", but not "c.example.org"

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a>: a new RequestTTY option provides control over when a
   TTY is requested for a connection, similar to the existing -t/-tt/-T
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> commandline options.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow GSSAPI authentication to detect when a server-side
   failure causes authentication failure and don't count such failures
   against MaxAuthTries; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1244">bz#1244</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: Add -A option. For each of the key types (rsa1, rsa,
   dsa and ecdsa) for which host keys do not exist, generate the host
   keys with the default key file path, an empty passphrase, default
   bits for the key type, and default comment. This is useful for
   system initialisation scripts.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Allow graceful shutdown of multiplexing: request that a mux
   server removes its listener socket and refuse future multiplexing
   requests but don't kill existing connections. This may be requested
   using "ssh -O stop ..."

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a> now accepts keys piped from standard input. E.g.
   "ssh-add - &lt; /path/to/key"
 
 * ssh-keysign(8) now signs hostbased authentication
   challenges correctly using ECDSA keys; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1858">bz#1858</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: document that sftp accepts square brackets to delimit
   addresses (useful for IPv6); <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1847">bz#1847</a>a

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when using session multiplexing, the master process will
   change its process title to reflect the control path in use and
   when a ControlPersist-ed master is waiting to close; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1883">bz#1883</a> and
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1911">bz#1911</a>

 * Fix a compilation error in the SELinux support code. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1851">bz#1851</a>

 * This release removes support for ssh-rand-helper. OpenSSH now
   obtains its random numbers directly from OpenSSL or from
   a PRNGd/EGD instance specified at configure time.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now resets the SELinux process execution context before
   executing passwd for password changes; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1891">bz#1891</a>

 * Since gcc &gt;= 4.x ignores all -Wno-options options, test only the

   scripts.

 * Updated .spec and init files for Linux; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1920">bz#1920</a>

 * Improved SELinux error messages in context change failures and
   suppress error messages when attempting to change from the
   "unconfined_t" type; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1924">bz#1924</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1919">bz#1919</a>

Changes since OpenSSH 5.8p1
===========================

Security:

 * Fix local private host key compromise on platforms without host-
   level randomness support (e.g. /dev/random) reported by Tomas Mraz

   On hosts that did not have a randomness source configured in
   OpenSSL and were not configured to use EGD/PRNGd (using the
   --with-prngd-socket configure option), the ssh-rand-helper command
   was being implicitly executed by ssh-keysign with open file
   descriptors to the host private keys. An attacker could use
   ptrace(2) to attach to ssh-rand-helper and exfiltrate the keys.

   Most modern operating systems are not vulnerable. In particular,
   *BSD, Linux, OS X and Cygwin do not use ssh-rand-helper.

   A full advisory for this issue is available at:
   <a href="http://www.openssh.com/txt/portable-keysign-rand-helper.adv">http://www.openssh.com/txt/portable-keysign-rand-helper.adv</a>

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * Fix compilation failure when enabling SELinux support.

 * Revised Cygwin ssh-{host,user}-config that include ECDSA key
   support.

 * Revised Cygwin ssh-host-config to be more thorough in error checking
   and reporting.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.7
=========================

Security:

 * Fix vulnerability in legacy certificate signing introduced in
   OpenSSH-5.6 and found by Mateusz Kocielski.

   Legacy certificates signed by OpenSSH 5.6 or 5.7 included data from
   the stack in place of a random nonce field. The contents of the stack
   do not appear to contain private data at this point, but this cannot
   be stated with certainty for all platform, library and compiler
   combinations. In particular, there exists a risk that some bytes from
   the privileged CA key may be accidentally included.

   A full advisory for this issue is available at:
   <a href="http://www.openssh.com/txt/legacy-cert.adv">http://www.openssh.com/txt/legacy-cert.adv</a>

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * Fix compilation failure when enableing SELinux support.

 * Do not attempt to call SELinux functions when SELinux is disabled.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.6
=========================

Features:

 * Implement Elliptic Curve Cryptography modes for key exchange (ECDH)
   and host/user keys (ECDSA) as specified by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656">RFC5656</a>. ECDH and ECDSA
   offer better performance than plain DH and DSA at the same equivalent
   symmetric key length, as well as much shorter keys.
     
   Only the mandatory sections of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656">RFC5656</a> are implemented, specifically
   the three REQUIRED curves nistp256, nistp384 and nistp521 and only
   ECDH and ECDSA. Point compression (optional in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656">RFC5656</a>) is NOT
   implemented.
     
   Certificate host and user keys using the new ECDSA key types are
   supported - an ECDSA key may be certified, and an ECDSA key may act
   as a CA to sign certificates.

   ECDH in a 256 bit curve field is the preferred key agreement
   algorithm when both the client and server support it. ECDSA host
   keys are preferred when learning a host's keys for the first time,
   or can be learned using ssh-keyscan(1).
     
 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: add a protocol extension to support a hard
   link operation. It is available through the "ln" command in the
   client. The old "ln" behaviour of creating a symlink is available
   using its "-s" option or through the preexisting "symlink" command

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: Add a new -3 option to scp: Copies between two remote hosts
   are transferred through the local host.  Without this option the
   data is copied directly between the two remote hosts. 

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: automatically order the hostkeys requested by the client
   based on which hostkeys are already recorded in known_hosts. This
   avoids hostkey warnings when connecting to servers with new ECDSA
   keys, since these are now preferred when learning hostkeys for the
   first time.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a new IPQoS option to specify arbitrary
   TOS/DSCP/QoS values instead of hardcoding lowdelay/throughput.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1733">bz#1733</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: the sftp client is now significantly faster at performing
   directory listings, using OpenBSD glob(3) extensions to preserve
   the results of stat(3) operations performed in the course of its
   execution rather than performing expensive round trips to fetch
   them again afterwards.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: "atomically" create the listening mux socket by binding it on
   a temporary name and then linking it into position after listen() has
   succeeded. This allows the mux clients to determine that the server
   socket is either ready or stale without races. stale server sockets
   are now automatically removed. (also fixes <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1711">bz#1711</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a KexAlgorithms knob to the client and server
   configuration to allow selection of which key exchange methods are
   used by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> and their order of preference.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: factor out bandwidth limiting code from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> into
   a generic bandwidth limiter that can be attached using the atomicio
   callback mechanism and use it to add a bandwidth limit option to
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1147">bz#1147</a>
 
BugFixes:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: honour $TMPDIR for client xauth and ssh-agent
   temporary directories. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1809">bz#1809</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: avoid NULL deref on receiving a channel request on an unknown
   or invalid channel; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1842">bz#1842</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove a debug() that pollutes stderr on client connecting
   to a server in debug mode; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1719">bz#1719</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>: pass through ssh command-line flags and options when doing
   remote-remote transfers, e.g. to enable agent forwarding which is
   particularly useful in this case; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1837">bz#1837</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: umask should be parsed as octal

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: escape '[' in filename tab-completion

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Typo in confirmation message.  <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1827">bz#1827</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: prevent free() of string in .rodata when overriding
   AuthorizedKeys in a Match block

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Use default shell /bin/sh if $SHELL is ""

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: kill proxy command on fatal() (we already killed it on
   clean exit);

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: install a SIGCHLD handler to reap expiried child process;
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1812">bz#1812</a>

 * Support building against openssl-1.0.0a

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * Use mandoc as preferred manpage formatter if it is present, followed
   by nroff and groff respectively.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Relax permission requirement on btmp logs to allow group
   read/write

 * <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1840">bz#1840</a>: fix warning when configuring --with-ssl-engine

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Use correct uid_t/pid_t types instead of int. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1817">bz#1817</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1824">bz#1824</a>: Add Solaris Project support.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Check is_selinux_enabled for exact return code since it can
   apparently return -1 under some conditions.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.5
=========================

Features:

 * Added a ControlPersist option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> that automatically
   starts a background <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> multiplex master when connecting. This
   connection can stay alive indefinitely, or can be set to
   automatically close after a user-specified duration of inactivity.

 * Hostbased authentication may now use certificate host keys. CA keys
   must be specified in a known_hosts file using the @cert-authority
   marker as described in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> now supports signing certificate using a CA key that
   has been stored in a PKCS#11 token.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> will now log the hostname and address that we connected to at
   LogLevel=verbose after authentication is successful to mitigate
   "phishing" attacks by servers with trusted keys that accept
   authentication silently and automatically before presenting fake
   password/passphrase prompts.

   Note that, for such an attack to be successful, the user must have
   disabled StrictHostKeyChecking (enabled by default) or an attacker
   must have access to a trusted host key for the destination server.

 * Expand %h to the hostname in ssh_config Hostname options. While this
   sounds useless, it is actually handy for working with unqualified
   hostnames:
     
     Host *.*
        Hostname %h
     Host *
        Hostname %h.example.org
     
 * Allow <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> to import (-i) and export (-e) of PEM and PKCS#8
   keys in addition to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716">RFC4716</a> (SSH.COM) encodings via a new -m option 
   (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1749">bz#1749</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> will now queue debug messages for bad ownership or
   permissions on the user's keyfiles encountered during authentication
   and will send them after authentication has successfully completed.
   These messages may be viewed in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> at LogLevel=debug or higher.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> connection multiplexing now supports remote forwarding with
   dynamic port allocation and can report the allocated port back to
   the user:

     LPORT=`ssh -S muxsocket -R0:localhost:25 -O forward somehost`

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now supports indirection in matching of principal names
   listed in certificates. By default, if a certificate has an
   embedded principals list then the username on the server must match
   one of the names in the list for it to be accepted for
   authentication.

   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now has a new AuthorizedPrincipalsFile option to specify a
   file containing a list of names that may be accepted in place of the
   username when authorizing a certificate trusted via the
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> TrustedCAKeys option. Similarly, authentication
   using a CA trusted in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys now accepts a
   principals="name1[,name2,...]" to specify a list of permitted names.
     
   If either option is absent, the current behaviour of requiring the
   username to appear in principals continues to apply. These options
   are useful for role accounts, disjoint account namespaces and
   "user@realm"-style naming policies in certificates.
 
 * Additional <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> options are now valid inside Match blocks:

     AuthorizedKeysFile
     AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
     HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly
     PermitTunnel

 * Revised the format of certificate keys. The new format, identified as
   ssh-{dss,rsa}-cert-v01@openssh.com includes the following changes:
     
     - Adding a serial number field. This may be specified by the CA at
       the time of certificate signing.

     - Moving the nonce field to the beginning of the certificate where
       it can better protect against chosen-prefix attacks on the
       signature hash (currently infeasible against the SHA1 hash used)
     
     - Renaming the "constraints" field to "critical options"
     
     - Addng a new non-critical "extensions" field. The "permit-*"
       options are now extensions, rather than critical options to
       permit non-OpenSSH implementation of this key format to degrade
       gracefully when encountering keys with options they do not
       recognize.
     
   The older format is still supported for authentication and may still
   be used when signing certificates (use "ssh-keygen -t v00 ...").
   The v00 format, introduced in OpenSSH 5.4, will be supported for at
   least one year from this release, after which it will be deprecated
   and removed.
     
BugFixes:

 * The PKCS#11 code now retries a lookup for a private key if there is
   no matching key with CKA_SIGN attribute enabled; this fixes fixes
   MuscleCard support (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1736">bz#1736</a>)
    
 * Unbreak strdelim() skipping past quoted strings (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1757">bz#1757</a>). For

       AllowUsers "blah blah" blah

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: fix swapped args in upload_dir_internal(), breaking
   recursive upload depth checks and causing verbose printing of
   transfers to always be turned on (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1797">bz#1797</a>)

   (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564">bz#1564</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: fix a memory leak in do_realpath() error path (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1771">bz#1771</a>)

 * ssk-keygen(1): Standardise error messages when attempting to open
   private key files to include "progname: filename: error reason"
   (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1783">bz#1783</a>)

 * Replace verbose and overflow-prone Linebuf code with
   read_keyfile_line() (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565">bz#1565</a>)

 * Include the user name on "subsystem request for ..." log messages

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove hardcoded limit of 100 permitopen clauses
   and port forwards per direction (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1327">bz#1327</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: ignore stderr output from subsystems to avoid hangs if a
   subsystem or shell initialisation writes to stderr (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1750">bz#1750</a>)

 * Skip the initial check for access with an empty password when
   PermitEmptyPasswords=no (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1638">bz#1638</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: display a more helpful error message when $HOME is
   inaccessible while trying to create .ssh directory (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1740">bz#1740</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix hang when terminating a mux slave using ~. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1758">bz#1758</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: refuse to generate keys longer than
   OPENSSL_[RD]SA_MAX_MODULUS_BITS, since we would refuse to use
   them anyway (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1516">bz#1516</a>)

 * Suppress spurious tty warning when using -O and stdin is not a tty

This is a major feature and bugfix release.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.3
=========================

Features:

 * After a transition period of about 10 years, this release disables
   SSH protocol 1 by default. Clients and servers that need to use the
   legacy protocol must explicitly enable it in ssh_config / sshd_config
   or on the command-line.

 * Remove the libsectok/OpenSC-based smartcard code and add support for
   PKCS#11 tokens. This support is automatically enabled on all
   platforms that support dlopen(3) and was inspired by patches written
   by Alon Bar-Lev. Details in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a> manpages.

 * Add support for certificate authentication of users and hosts using a
   new, minimal OpenSSH certificate format (not X.509). Certificates
   contain a public key, identity information and some validity
   constraints and are signed with a standard SSH public key using
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>. CA keys may be marked as trusted in authorized_keys
   or via a TrustedUserCAKeys option in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> (for user
   authentication), or in known_hosts (for host authentication).

   Documentation for certificate support may be found in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>,
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and a description of the protocol extensions in
   PROTOCOL.certkeys.

 * Added a 'netcat mode' to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: "ssh -W host:port ..." This connects
   stdio on the client to a single port forward on the server. This
   allows, for example, using ssh as a ProxyCommand to route connections
   via intermediate servers. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1618">bz#1618</a>

 * Add the ability to revoke keys in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>. User keys may
   be revoked using a new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> option "RevokedKeys". Host keys
   are revoked through known_hosts (details in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> man page).
   Revoked keys cannot be used for user or host authentication and will
   trigger a warning if used.

 * Rewrite the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> multiplexing support to support non-blocking
   operation of the mux master, improve the resilience of the master to
   malformed messages sent to it by the slave and add support for
   requesting port- forwardings via the multiplex protocol. The new
   stdio-to-local forward mode ("ssh -W host:port ...") is also
   supported. The revised multiplexing protocol is documented in the
   file PROTOCOL.mux in the source distribution.

 * Add a 'read-only' mode to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a> that disables open in write
   mode and all other fs-modifying protocol methods. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430">bz#430</a>

 * Allow setting an explicit umask on the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a> commandline to
   override whatever default the user has. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1229">bz#1229</a>

 * Many improvements to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> client, many of which were
   implemented by Carlos Silva through the Google Summer of Code
   program:
   - Support the "-h" (human-readable units) flag for ls
   - Implement tab-completion of commands, local and remote filenames
   - Support most of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>'s commandline arguments in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>, as a
     first step towards making <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>.
     Note that the rarely-used "-P sftp_server_path" option has been
     moved to "-D sftp_server_path" to make way for "-P port" to match
     <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>.
   - Add recursive transfer support for get/put and on the commandline

 * New RSA keys will be generated with a public exponent of RSA_F4 ==
   (2**16)+1 == 65537 instead of the previous value 35.

 * Passphrase-protected SSH protocol 2 private keys are now protected
   with AES-128 instead of 3DES. This applied to newly-generated keys
   as well as keys that are reencrypted (e.g. by changing their
   passphrase).

Bugfixes:

 * Hold authentication debug messages until after successful
   authentication. Fixes a minor information leak of environment
   variables specified in authorized_keys if an attacker happens to
   know the public key in use.
 * When using ChrootDirectory, make sure we test for the existence of
   the user's shell inside the chroot and not outside (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1679">bz#1679</a>)
 * Cache user and group name lookups in sftp-server using
   user_from_[ug]id(3) to improve performance on hosts where these
   operations are slow (e.g. NIS or LDAP). <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495">bz#1495</a>
 * Fix problem that prevented passphrase reading from being interrupted
   in some circumstances; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1590">bz#1590</a>
 * Ignore and log any Protocol 1 keys where the claimed size is not
   equal to the actual size.
 * Make HostBased authentication work with a ProxyCommand. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1569">bz#1569</a>
 * Avoid run-time failures when specifying hostkeys via a relative
   path by prepending the current working directory in these cases.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1290">bz#1290</a>
 * Do not prompt for a passphrase if we fail to open a keyfile, and log
   the reason why the open failed to debug. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1693">bz#1693</a>
 * Document that the PubkeyAuthentication directive is allowed in a
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> Match block. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577">bz#1577</a>
 * When converting keys, truncate key comments at 72 chars as per
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716">RFC4716</a>. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1630">bz#1630</a>
 * Do not allow logins if /etc/nologin exists but is not readable by the
   user logging in.
 * Output a debug log if <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> can't open an existing authorized_keys.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1694">bz#1694</a>
 * Quell tc[gs]etattr warnings when forcing a tty (ssh -tt), since we
   usually don't actually have a tty to read/set; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1686">bz#1686</a>
 * Prevent sftp from crashing when given a "-" without a command.
   Also, allow whitespace to follow a "-". <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1691">bz#1691</a>
 * After sshd receives a SIGHUP, ignore subsequent HUPs while sshd
   re-execs itself. Prevents two HUPs in quick succession from resulting
   in sshd dying. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1692">bz#1692</a>
 * Clarify in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> that StrictModes does not apply to
   ChrootDirectory. Permissions and ownership are always checked when
   chrooting. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1532">bz#1532</a>
 * Set close-on-exec on various descriptors so they don't get leaked to
   child processes. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1643">bz#1643</a>
 * Fix very rare race condition in x11/agent channel allocation: don't
   read after the end of the select read/write fdset and make sure a
   reused FD is not touched before the pre-handlers are called.
 * Fix incorrect exit status when multiplexing and channel ID 0 is
   recycled. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1570">bz#1570</a>
 * Fail with an error when an attempt is made to connect to a server
   with ForceCommand=internal-sftp with a shell session (i.e. not a
   subsystem session). Avoids stuck client when attempting to ssh to
   such a service. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1606">bz#1606</a>:
 * Warn but do not fail if stat()ing the subsystem binary fails. This
   helps with chrootdirectory+forcecommand=sftp-server and restricted
   shells. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599">bz #1599</a>
 * Change "Connecting to host..." message to "Connected to host."
   and delay it until after the sftp protocol connection has been
   established. Avoids confusing sequence of messages when the
   underlying ssh connection experiences problems. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1588">bz#1588</a>
 * Use the HostKeyAlias rather than the hostname specified on the
   commandline when prompting for passwords. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1039">bz#1039</a>
 * Correct off-by-one in percent_expand(): we would fatal() when trying
   to expand EXPAND_MAX_KEYS, allowing only EXPAND_MAX_KEYS-1 to
   actually work. Note that nothing in OpenSSH actually uses close to
   this limit at present. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607">bz#1607</a>
 * Fix passing of empty options from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> to the
   underlying <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>. Also add support for the stop option "--".
 * Fix an incorrect magic number and typo in PROTOCOL; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1688">bz#1688</a>
 * Don't escape backslashes when displaying the SSH2 banner. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1533">bz#1533</a>
 * Don't unnecessarily dup() the in and out fds for sftp-server. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1566">bz#1566</a>
 * Force use of the correct hash function for random-art signature
   display as it was inheriting the wrong one when bubblebabble
   signatures were activated. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1611">bz#1611</a>
 * Do not fall back to adding keys without constraints (ssh-add -c /
   -t ...) when the agent refuses the constrained add request. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612">bz#1612</a>
 * Fix a race condition in ssh-agent that could result in a wedged or
   spinning agent. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1633">bz#1633</a>
 * Flush stdio before exec() to ensure that everying (motd
   in particular) has made it out before the streams go away. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1596">bz#1596</a>
 * Set FD_CLOEXEC on in/out sockets in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1706">bz#1706</a>

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * Use system's kerberos principal name on AIX if it's available.
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1583">bz#1583</a>
 * Disable OOM-killing of the listening sshd on Linux. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1470">bz#1470</a>
 * Use pkg-config for opensc config if it's available. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1160">bz#1160</a>
 * Unbreak Redhat spec to allow building without askpass. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1677">bz#1677</a>
 * If PidFile is set in sshd_config, use it in SMF init file. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1628">bz#1628</a>
 * Print error and usage() when ssh-rand-helper is passed command-
   line arguments as none are supported. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568">bz#1568</a>
 * Add missing setsockopt() to set IPV6_V6ONLY for local forwarding
   with GatwayPorts=yes. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1648">bz#1648</a>
 * Make GNOME 2 askpass dialog desktop-modal. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1645">bz#1645</a>
 * If SELinux is enabled set the security context to "sftpd_t" before
   running the internal sftp server. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637">bz#1637</a>
 * Correctly check libselinux for necessary SELinux functions; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1713">bz#1713</a>
 * Unbreak builds on Redhat using the supplied openssh.spec; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1731">bz#1731</a>
 * Fix incorrect privilege dropping order on AIX that prevented
   chroot operation; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1567">bz#1567</a>
 * Call aix_setauthdb/aix_restoredb at the correct times on AIX to
   prevent authentication failure; <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1710">bz#1710</a>

Changes since OpenSSH 5.2
=========================

General Bugfixes:

 * Do not limit home directory paths to 256 characters. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1615">bz#1615</a>

 * Several minor documentation and correctness fixes.

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * This release removes for support for very old versions of Cygwin and
   for Windows 95/98/ME

 * Move the deletion of PAM credentials on logout to after the session
   close. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1534">bz#1534</a>

 * Make PrintLastLog work on AIX. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1595">bz#1595</a>

 * Avoid compile errors on FreeBSD from conflicts in glob.h. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1634">bz#1634</a>

 * Delay dropping of root privileges on AIX so chroot and pam_open_session
   work correctly. <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1249">bz#1249</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1567">bz#1567</a>

The focus of this release has been on bugfixes as the previous
openssh-5.1 release introduced many new features and made some
invasive changes.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.1
=========================

Security:

 * This release changes the default cipher order to prefer the AES CTR
   modes and the revised "arcfour256" mode to CBC mode ciphers that are
   susceptible to CPNI-957037 "Plaintext Recovery Attack Against SSH".

 * This release also adds countermeasures to mitigate CPNI-957037-style
   attacks against the SSH protocol's use of CBC-mode ciphers. Upon
   detection of an invalid packet length or Message Authentication
   Code, ssh/sshd will continue reading up to the maximum supported
   packet length rather than immediately terminating the connection.
   This eliminates most of the known differences in behaviour that
   leaked information about the plaintext of injected data which formed
   the basis of this attack. We believe that these attacks are rendered
   infeasible by these changes.

New features:

 * Added a -y option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> to force logging to syslog rather than
   stderr, which is useful when running daemonised (ssh -f)

 * The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> ForceCommand directive now accepts commandline
   arguments for the internal-sftp server.

 * The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> ~C escape commandline now support runtime creation of
   dynamic (-D) port forwards.

 * Support the SOCKS4A protocol in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> dynamic (-D) forwards.
   (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1482">bz#1482</a>)

 * Support remote port forwarding with a listen port of '0'. This
   informs the server that it should dynamically allocate a listen
   port and report it back to the client. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1003">bz#1003</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now supports setting PermitEmptyPasswords and
   AllowAgentForwarding in Match blocks

Bug and documentation fixes

 * Repair a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> crash introduced in openssh-5.1 when the client is
   sent a zero-length banner (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1496">bz#1496</a>)

 * Due to interoperability problems with certain
   broken SSH implementations, the eow@openssh.com and
   no-more-sessions@openssh.com protocol extensions are now only sent
   to peers that identify themselves as OpenSSH.

 * Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> send the correct channel number for
   SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_SUCCESS and SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE messages to
   avoid triggering 'Non-public channel' error messages on <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> in
   openssh-5.1.

 * Avoid printing 'Non-public channel' warnings in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, since the
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> has sent incorrect channel numbers since ~2004 (this reverts
   a behaviour introduced in openssh-5.1).

 * Avoid double-free in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> ~C escape -L handler (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1539">bz#1539</a>)

 * Correct fail-on-error behaviour in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> batchmode for remote
   stat operations. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1541">bz#1541</a>)

 * Disable nonfunctional <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> ~C escape handler in multiplex slave
   connections. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1543">bz#1543</a>)

 * Avoid hang in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> when attempting to connect to a server that
   has MaxSessions=0 set.

 * Multiple fixes to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> configuration test (-T) mode

 * Several core and portable OpenSSH bugs fixed: 1380, 1412, 1418,
   1419, 1421, 1490, 1491, 1492, 1514, 1515, 1518, 1520, 1538, 1540

 * Many manual page improvements.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.0
=========================

Security:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: Avoid X11 man-in-the-middle attack on HP/UX (and possibly
   other platforms) when X11UseLocalhost=no

   When attempting to bind(2) to a port that has previously been bound
   with SO_REUSEADDR set, most operating systems check that either the
   effective user-id matches the previous bind (common on BSD-derived
   systems) or that the bind addresses do not overlap (Linux and
   Solaris).

   Some operating systems, such as HP/UX, do not perform these checks
   and are vulnerable to an X11 man-in-the-middle attack when the
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> option X11UseLocalhost has been set to "no" - an
   attacker may establish a more-specific bind, which will be used in
   preference to sshd's wildcard listener.

   Modern BSD operating systems, Linux, OS X and Solaris implement the
   above checks and are not vulnerable to this attack, nor are systems
   where the X11UseLocalhost has been left at the default value of
   "yes".

   Portable OpenSSH 5.1 avoids this problem for all operating systems
   by not setting SO_REUSEADDR when X11UseLocalhost is set to no.

   This vulnerability was reported by sway2004009 AT hotmail.com.

New features:

 * Introduce experimental SSH Fingerprint ASCII Visualisation to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>
   and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>. Visual fingerprinnt display is controlled by a new
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> option "VisualHostKey". The intent is to render
   SSH host keys in a visual form that is amenable to easy recall and
   rejection of changed host keys. This technique inspired by the
   graphical hash visualisation schemes known as "random art[*]", and
   by Dan Kaminsky's musings at 23C3 in Berlin.

   Fingerprint visualisation in is currently disabled by default, as the
   algorithm used to generate the random art is still subject to change.

   [*] "Hash Visualization: a New Technique to improve Real-World
       Security", Perrig A. and Song D., 1999, International Workshop on
       Cryptographic Techniques and E-Commerce (CrypTEC '99)
   <a href="http://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/validation.pdf">http://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/validation.pdf</a>

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> now supports CIDR address/masklen matching in "Match
   address" blocks, with a fallback to classic wildcard matching. For 
   example:
     Match address 192.0.2.0/24,3ffe:ffff::/32,!10.*
         PasswordAuthentication yes

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now supports CIDR matching in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   from="..." restrictions, also with a fallback to classic wildcard
   matching.

 * Added an extended test mode (-T) to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> to request that it write
   its effective configuration to stdout and exit. Extended test mode
   also supports the specification of connection parameters (username,
   source address and hostname) to test the application of
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> Match rules. 

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> now prints the number of bytes transferred and the overall
   connection throughput for SSH protocol 2 sessions when in verbose
   mode (previously these statistics were displayed for protocol 1
   connections only).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a> now supports extension methods statvfs@openssh.com and
   fstatvfs@openssh.com that implement statvfs(2)-like operations.
   (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399">bz#1399</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> now has a "df" command to the sftp client that uses the
   statvfs@openssh.com to produce a df(1)-like display of filesystem
   space and inode utilisation (requires statvfs@openssh.com support on
   the server)

 * Added a MaxSessions option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> to allow control of the
   number of multiplexed sessions supported over a single TCP connection.
   This allows increasing the number of allowed sessions above the
   previous default of 10, disabling connection multiplexing 
   (MaxSessions=1) or disallowing login/shell/subsystem sessions
   entirely (MaxSessions=0).

 * Added a no-more-sessions@openssh.com global request extension that is
   sent from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> when the client knows that it will never
   request another session (i.e. when session multiplexing is disabled). 
   This allows a server to disallow further session requests and
   terminate the session in cases where the client has been hijacked.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> now supports the use of the -l option in combination
   with -F to search for a host in ~/.ssh/known_hosts and display its 
   fingerprint.

 * ssh-keyscan(1) now defaults to "rsa" (protocol 2) keys, instead of
   "rsa1".

 * Added an AllowAgentForwarding option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.8">sshd_config(8)</a> to control
   whether authentication agent forwarding is permitted. Note that this
   is a loose control, as a client may install their own unofficial
   forwarder.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: avoid unnecessary malloc/copy/free when receiving
   network data, resulting in a ~10% speedup

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> will now try additional addresses when connecting
   to a port forward destination whose DNS name resolves to more than
   one address. The previous behaviour was to try the only first address
   and give up if that failed. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=383">bz#383</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now support signalling that channels are
   half-closed for writing, through a channel protocol extension
   notification "eow@openssh.com". This allows propagation of closed
   file descriptors, so that commands such as:
       "ssh -2 localhost od /bin/ls | true"
   do not send unnecessary data over the wire. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85">bz#85</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: increased the default size of ssh protocol 1 ephemeral keys 
   from 768 to 1024 bits.

 * When <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> has been requested to fork after authentication
   ("ssh -f") with ExitOnForwardFailure enabled, delay the fork until
   after replies for any -R forwards have been seen. Allows for robust
   detection of -R forward failure when using -f. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92">bz#92</a>)

 * "Match group" blocks in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> now support negation of
   groups. E.g. "Match group staff,!guests" (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1315">bz#1315</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a> now allow chmod-like operations to set 
   set[ug]id/sticky bits. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310">bz#1310</a>)

 * The MaxAuthTries option is now permitted in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> match
   blocks.

 * Multiplexed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> sessions now support a subset of the ~ escapes
   that are available to a primary connection. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1331">bz#1331</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> connection multiplexing will now fall back to creating a new
   connection in most error cases. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1439">bz#1439</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1329">bz#1329</a>)

 * Added some basic interoperability tests against Twisted Conch.

 * Documented OpenSSH's extensions to and deviations from the published
   SSH protocols (the PROTOCOL file in the distribution)

 * Documented OpenSSH's ssh-agent protocol (PROTOCOL.agent).

Bug and documentation fixes

 * Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> deal more gracefully with channel requests that fail.
   Previously it would optimistically assume that requests would always 
   succeed, which could cause hangs if they did not (e.g. when the
   server runs out of file descriptors). (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1384">bz#1384</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> now reports multiplexing errors via the multiplex slave's
   stderr where possible (subject to LogLevel in the mux master).

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now send terminate protocol banners with CR+LF for
   protocol 2 to comply with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253">RFC 4253</a>. Previously they were terminated
   with CR alone. Protocol 1 banners remain CR terminated. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1443">bz#1443</a>)

 * Merged duplicate authentication file checks in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> and refuse to
   read authorised_keys and .shosts from non-regular files. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438">bz#1438</a>)

 * Ensure that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>'s umask disallows at least group and world write,
   even if a more permissive one has been inherited. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433">bz#1433</a>)

 * Suppress the warning message from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> when changing to a
   non-existent user home directory after chrooting. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1461">bz#1461</a>)

 * Mention that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> follows symlinks when performing recursive
   copies. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1466">bz#1466</a>)

 * Prevent <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> from erroneously applying public key restrictions
   leaned from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to other authentication methods
   when public key authentication subsequently fails. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1472">bz#1472</a>)

 * Fix protocol keepalive timeouts - in some cases, keepalive packets
   were being sent, but the connection was not being closed when the
   limit for missing replies was exceeded. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1465">bz#1465</a>)

 * Fix <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> sending invalid TTY modes when a TTY was forced (ssh -tt)
   but stdin was not a TTY. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1199">bz#1199</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> will now exit with a non-zero exit status if
   ExitOnForwardFailure was set and forwardings were disabled due to a
   failed host key check.

 * Fix MaxAuthTries tests to disallow a free authentication try to
   clients that skipped the protocol 2 "none" authentication method.
   (part of <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432">bz#1432</a>)

 * Make keepalive timeouts apply while synchronously waiting
   for a packet, particularly during key renegotiation. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1363">bz#1363</a>)

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> has been audited to eliminate fd leaks and calls to fatal()
   in conditions of file descriptor exhaustion.

Portable OpenSSH-specific bugfixes

 * Avoid a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> hang-on-exit on Solaris caused by depending on the 
   success of isatty() on a PTY master (undefined behaviour). Probably 
   affected other platforms too. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1463">bz#1463</a>)

 * Fixed test for locked accounts on HP/UX with shadowed
   passwords disabled. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1083">bz#1083</a>)

 * Disable poll() fallback in atomiciov for Tru64. readv
   doesn't seem to be a comparable object there, which lead to
   compilation errors. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1386">bz#1386</a>)

 * Fall back to racy rename if link returns EXDEV. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447">bz#1447</a>)

 * Explicitly handle EWOULDBLOCK wherever we handle EAGAIN, on
   some platforms (HP nonstop) it is a distinct errno. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467">bz#1467</a>)

 * Avoid NULL dereferences in ancient sigaction replacement
   code. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1240">bz#1240</a>)

 * Avoid linking against libgssapi, which despite its name
   doesn't seem to implement all of GSSAPI. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1276">bz#1276</a>)

 * Use explicit noreturn attribute instead of __dead, fixing
   compilation problems on Interix. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1112">bz#1112</a>)

 * Added support password expiry on Tru64 SIA systems. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1241">bz#1241</a>)

 * Fixed an UMAC alignment problem that manifested on Itanium 
   platforms. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462">bz#1462</a>)

 * The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a> manual now describes the requirements for
   transfer logging in chroot environments. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1488">bz#1488</a>)

 * Strip trailing dot from hostnames when the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>
   HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly option is set. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1200">bz#1200</a>)

 * Disable execution of ~/.ssh/rc for sessions where a command has been
   forced by the sshd_config ForceCommand directive. Users who had
   write access to this file could use it to execute abritrary commands.
   This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe default and an extra
   hassle for administrators.

New features:

  * Added chroot(2) support for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, controlled by a new option
    "ChrootDirectory". Please refer to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> for details, and
    please use this feature carefully. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177">bz#177</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1352">bz#1352</a>)
  * Linked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a> into <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>. The internal sftp server is
    used when the command "internal-sftp" is specified in a Subsystem
    or ForceCommand declaration. When used with ChrootDirectory, the
    internal sftp server requires no special configuration of files
    inside the chroot environment. Please refer to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> for
    more information.
  * Added a "no-user-rc" option for authorized_keys to disable execution
    of ~/.ssh/rc
  * Added a protocol extension method "posix-rename@openssh.com" for
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a> to perform POSIX atomic rename() operations.
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1400">bz#1400</a>)
  * Removed the fixed limit of 100 file handles in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>. The
    server will now dynamically allocate handles up to the number of
    available file descriptors. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397">bz#1397</a>)
  * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.8">ssh(8)</a> will now skip generation of SSH protocol 1 ephemeral server
    keys when in inetd mode and protocol 2 connections are negotiated.
    This speeds up protocol 2 connections to inetd-mode servers that
    also allow Protocol 1 (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440">bz#440</a>)
  * Accept the PermitRootLogin directive in a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> Match
    block. Allows for, e.g. permitting root only from the local
    network.
  * Reworked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> argument splitting and escaping to be more
    internally consistent (i.e. between sftp commands) and more
    consistent with sh(1). Please note that this will change the
    interpretation of some quoted strings, especially those with
    embedded backslash escape sequences. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778">bz#778</a>)
  * Support "Banner=none" in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> to disable sending of a
    pre-login banner (e.g. in a Match block).
  * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> ProxyCommands are now executed with $SHELL rather than
    /bin/sh.
  * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>'s ConnectTimeout option is now applied to both the TCP
    connection and the SSH banner exchange (previously it just covered
    the TCP connection). This allows callers of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> to better detect
    and deal with stuck servers that accept a TCP connection but don't
    progress the protocol, and also makes ConnectTimeout useful for
    connections via a ProxyCommand.
  * Many new regression tests, including interop tests against PuTTY's
    plink.
  * Support BSM auditing on Mac OS X

The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

   - <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> incorrectly reported "stalled" on slow copies. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799">bz#799</a>)

   - SSH2_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED packets did not correctly reset the client
     keepalive logic, causing disconnections on servers that did not
     explicitly implement "keepalive@openssh.com". (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1307">bz#1307</a>)
   - <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> used the obsolete SIG DNS RRtype for host keys in DNS,

   - Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> skip listening on the IPv6 wildcard address when a
     binding address of 0.0.0.0 is used against an old SSH server that
     does not support the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254">RFC4254</a> syntax for wildcard bind addresses.

     protocol: 2**32-1. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1390">bz#1390</a>)
   - Enable IPV6_V6ONLY socket option on <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> listen socket, as is
     already done for X11/TCP forwarding sockets. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392">bz#1392</a>)
   - Fix FD leak that could hang a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> connection multiplexing

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures

Changes since OpenSSH 4.6:
============================

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Prevent <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> from using a trusted X11 cookie if creation of an
   untrusted cookie fails; found and fixed by Jan Pechanec.

Other changes, new functionality and fixes in this release:

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> in new installations defaults to SSH Protocol 2 only.
   Existing installations are unchanged.

 * The SSH channel window size has been increased, and both <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>
   <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now send window updates more aggressively. These improves
   performance on high-BDP (Bandwidth Delay Product) networks.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now preserve MAC contexts between packets, which
   saves 2 hash calls per packet and results in 12-16% speedup for
   arcfour256/hmac-md5.

 * A new MAC algorithm has been added, UMAC-64 (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4418">RFC4418</a>) as
   "umac-64@openssh.com". UMAC-64 has been measured to be 
   approximately 20% faster than HMAC-MD5.

 * A -K flag was added to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> to set GSSAPIAuthentication=Yes

 * Failure to establish a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> TunnelForward is now treated as a
   fatal error when the ExitOnForwardFailure option is set.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> returns a sensible exit status if the control master goes
   away without passing the full exit status. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1261">bz #1261</a>)

 * The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

   - When using a ProxyCommand in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, set the outgoing hostname with
     gethostname(2), allowing hostbased authentication to work (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616">bz #616</a>)
   - Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> skip FIFOs rather than hanging (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856">bz #856</a>)
   - Encode non-printing characters in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> filenames.
     these could cause copies to be aborted with a "protocol error"
     (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=891">bz #891</a>)
   - Handle SIGINT in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> privilege separation child process to
     ensure that wtmp and lastlog records are correctly updated
     (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1196">bz #1196</a>)
   - Report GSSAPI mechanism in errors, for libraries that support
     multiple mechanisms (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1220">bz #1220</a>)
   - Improve documentation for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>'s -d option (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1224">bz #1224</a>)
   - Rearrange and tidy GSSAPI code, removing server-only code being
     linked into the client. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1225">bz #1225</a>)
   - Delay execution of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>'s LocalCommand until after all forwadings
     have been established. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1232">bz #1232</a>)
   - In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>, do not truncate non-regular files (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1236">bz #1236</a>)
   - Improve exit message from ControlMaster clients. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1262">bz #1262</a>)
   - Prevent <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a> from reading until it runs out of buffer
     space, whereupon it would exit with a fatal error. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1286">bz #1286</a>)

 * Portable OpenSSH bugs fixed:

   - Fix multiple inclusion of paths.h on AIX 5.1 systems. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1243">bz #1243</a>)
   - Implement getpeereid for Solaris using getpeerucred. Solaris
     systems will now refuse <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> ControlMaster
     clients from different, non-root users (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1287">bz #1287</a>)
   - Fix compilation warnings by including string.h if found. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1294">bz #1294</a>)
   - Remove redefinition of _res in getrrsetbyname.c for platforms that
     already define it. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1299">bz #1299</a>)
   - Fix spurious "chan_read_failed for istate 3" errors from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>,
     a side-effect of the "hang on exit" fix introduced in 4.6p1.
     (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1306">bz #1306</a>)
   - pam_end() was not being called if authentication failed (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1322">bz #1322</a>)
   - Fix SELinux support when SELinux is in permissive mode. Previously
     <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> was treating SELinux errors as always fatal. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325">bz #1325</a>)
   - Ensure that pam_setcred(..., PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED) is called before
     pam_setcred(..., PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED), fixing pam_dhkeys.
     (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1339">bz #1339</a>)
   - Fix privilege separation on QNX - pre-auth only, this platform does
     not support file descriptior passing needed for post-auth privilege
     separation. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1343">bz #1343</a>)

============================

This is a bugfix only release. No new features have been added.

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Fix a bug in the sshd privilege separation monitor that weakened its
   verification of successful authentication. This bug is not known to
   be exploitable in the absence of additional vulnerabilities.

Changes since OpenSSH 4.3:
============================

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
   that would cause <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> to spin until the login grace time
   expired.

 * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
   handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
   to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
   OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
   pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
   is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
   remote.

 * On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
   be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.

This release includes the following new functionality and fixes:

 * Implemented conditional configuration in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> using the
   "Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
   selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
   hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of post-
   authentication options are supported and more are expected to be
   added in future releases.

 * Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
   final hash of SHA256.

 * Added a "ForceCommand" directive to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>. Similar to the
   command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, this forces
   the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
   requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
   option.

 * Add a "PermitOpen" directive to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>. This mirrors the
   permitopen="..." authorized_keys option, allowing fine-grained
   control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
   establish.

 * Add optional logging of transactions to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>.

 * <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys when a non-standard port has been requested.

 * Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> to exit (with
   a non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
   established.

 * Extend <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
   specification of command-line arguments.

 * Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
   malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.

 * Many manpage fixes and improvements

 * New portable OpenSSH-specific features:

   - Add optional support for SELinux, controlled using the
     --with-selinux configure option (experimental)

   - Add optional support for Solaris process contracts, enabled
     using the --with-solaris-contracts configure option (experimental)
     This option will also include SMF metadata in Solaris packages
     built using the "make package" target

   - Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
     enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.

 * Bugs from <a href="http://bugzilla.mindrot.org">http://bugzilla.mindrot.org</a> fixed:
    #482  - readconf doesn't accept paths with spaces in them.
    #906  - syslog messages from sshd [net] lost.
    #975  - Kerberos authentication timing can leak information
            about account validity.
    #981  - Flow stop in SSH2.

    #1162 - Inappropriate sequence of syslog messages.
    #1166 - openssh-4.3p1 has some issues compiling.
    #1171 - configure can't always figure out LLONG_MAX..
    #1173 - scp reports lost connection for very large files.
    #1177 - Incorrect sshrc file location in Makefile.in.
    #1179 - sshd incorrectly rejects  connections due to IP options.
    #1181 - configure should detect when openssl-0.9.8x needs -ldl.
    #1186 - ssh tries multiple times to open unprotected keys.
    #1188 - keyboard-interactive should not allow retry after
            pam_acct_mgmt fails.
    #1193 - Open ssh will not allow changing of passwords on usernames
            greater than 8 characters..
    #1201 - Bind address information is not specified in command line
            help messages.
    #1203 - configure.ac is missing an open [.
    #1207 - sshd does not clear unsuccessful login count on
            non-interactive logins.
    #1218 - GSSAPI client code permits SPNEGO usage.
    #1221 - Banner only suppressed at log level = QUIET (used to be
            at log level &lt; INFO).

 * Fixes to memory and file descriptor leaks reported by the Coverity
   static analysis tool

 * Fixes to inconsistent pointer checks reported by the Stanford
   SATURN tool

Changes since Portable OpenSSH 4.3p1:
====================================

This is a release of Portable OpenSSH only, to resolve some 
portability bugs. There are no new features, only fixes: 

 * Explicitly test for egrep in ./configure, fixing a problem in 4.3p1
   that caused some platforms to fail to detect the available fields
   in utmp/wtmp/lastlog records. This bug manifested as missing or
   empty login/logout records (as seen by last(1), etc.)

 * Fix for logout records not being updated on platforms without 
   support for post-authentication privilege separation (e.g. Cygwin)

 * Fixed compilation problems on Ultrix, NewsOS and QNX

Changes since OpenSSH 4.2:
============================ 

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * CVE-2006-0225: scp (as does rcp, on which it is based) invoked a
   subshell to perform local to local, and remote to remote copy
   operations. This subshell exposed filenames to shell expansion
   twice; allowing a local attacker to create filenames containing
   shell metacharacters that, if matched by a wildcard, could lead
   to execution of attacker-specified commands with the privilege of
   the user running scp (Bugzilla #1094)

This is primarily a bug-fix release, only one new feature has been
added: 

 * Add support for tunneling arbitrary network packets over a
   connection between an OpenSSH client and server via tun(4) virtual
   network interfaces. This allows the use of OpenSSH (4.3+) to create
   a true VPN between the client and server providing real network
   connectivity at layer 2 or 3. This feature is experimental and is 
   currently supported on OpenBSD, Linux, NetBSD (IPv4 only) and 
   FreeBSD. Other operating systems with tun/tap interface capability 
   may be added in future portable OpenSSH releases. Please refer to 
   the README.tun file in the source distribution for further details
   and usage examples.

Some of the other bugs resolved and internal improvements are:

 * Reduce default key length for new DSA keys generated by ssh-keygen 
   back to 1024 bits. DSA is not specified for longer lengths and does 
   not fully benefit from simply making keys longer. As per FIPS 186-2 
   Change Notice 1, ssh-keygen will refuse to generate a new DSA key 
   smaller or larger than 1024 bits

 * Fixed X forwarding failing to start when a the X11 client is executed
   in background at the time of session exit (Bugzilla #1086)

 * Change ssh-keygen to generate a protocol 2 RSA key when invoked
   without arguments (Bugzilla #1064)

 * Fix timing variance for valid vs. invalid accounts when attempting
   Kerberos authentication (Bugzilla #975)

 * Ensure that ssh always returns code 255 on internal error (Bugzilla 
   #1137)

 * Cleanup wtmp files on SIGTERM when not using privsep (Bugzilla #1029)

 * Set SO_REUSEADDR on X11 listeners to avoid problems caused by
   lingering sockets from previous session (X11 applications can
   sometimes not connect to 127.0.0.1:60xx) (Bugzilla #1076)

 * Ensure that fds 0, 1 and 2 are always attached in all programs, by
   duping /dev/null to them if necessary.

 * Xauth list invocation had bogus "." argument (Bugzilla #1082)

 * Remove internal assumptions on key exchange hash algorithm and output
   length, preparing OpenSSH for KEX methods with alternate hashes.

 * Ignore junk sent by a server before  it sends the "SSH-" banner
   (Bugzilla #1067)

 * The manpages has been significantly improves and rearranged, in 
   addition to other specific manpage fixes:
   #1037 - Man page entries for -L and -R should mention -g.
   #1077 - Descriptions for "ssh -D" and DynamicForward should mention
           they can specify "bind_address" optionally.
   #1088 - Incorrect descriptions in ssh_config man page for 
           ControlMaster=no.
   #1121 - Several corrections for ssh_agent manpages

 * Lots of cleanups, including fixes to memory leaks on error paths
   (Bugzilla #1109, #1110, #1111 and more) and possible crashes (#1092)

 * Portable OpenSSH-specific fixes:

   - Pass random seed during re-exec for each connection: speeds up
     processing of new connections on platforms using the OpenSSH's
     builtin entropy collector (ssh-rand-helper)

   - PAM fixes and improvements:
     #1045 - Missing option for ignoring the /etc/nologin file
     #1087 - Show PAM password expiry message from LDAP on login
     #1028 - Forward final non-query conversations to client
     #1126 - Prevent user from being forced to change an expired
             password repeatedly on AIX in some PAM configurations.
     #1045 - Do not check /etc/nologin when PAM is enabled, instead 
             allow PAM to handle it.  Note that on platforms using 
             PAM, the pam_nologin module should be used in sshd's 
             session stack in order to maintain past behaviour

   - Portability-related fixes:
     #989  - Fix multiplexing regress test on Solaris
     #1097 - Cross-compile fixes.
     #1096 - ssh-keygen broken on HPUX.
     #1098 - $MAIL being set incorrectly for HPUX server login.
     #1104 - Compile error on Tru64 Unix 4.0f
     #1106 - Updated .spec file and startup for SuSE.
     #1122 - Use _GNU_SOURCE define in favor of __USE_GNU, fixing
             compilation problems on glibc 2.4

Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs or test
releases.

Changes since OpenSSH 4.1:
============================ 

  - SECURITY: Fix a bug introduced in OpenSSH 4.0 that caused 
    GatewayPorts to be incorrectly activated for dynamic ("-D") port 
    forwardings when no listen address was explicitly specified.

  - SECURITY: sshd in OpenSSH versions prior to 4.2 allow GSSAPI 
    credentials to be delegated to users who log in with methods 
    other than GSSAPI authentication (e.g. public key) when the 
    client requests it. This behaviour has been changed in OpenSSH 
    4.2 to only delegate credentials to users who authenticate
    using the GSSAPI method. This eliminates the risk of credentials 
    being inadvertently exposed to an untrusted user/host (though 
    users should not activate GSSAPIDelegateCredentials to begin
    with when the remote user or host is untrusted)

  - Added a new compression method that delays the start of zlib
    compression until the user has been authenticated successfully. 
    The new method ("Compression delayed") is on by default in the 
    server. This eliminates the risk of any zlib vulnerability 
    leading to a compromise of the server from unauthenticated users.

    NB. Older OpenSSH (&lt;3.5) versions have a bug that will cause them
    to refuse to connect to any server that does not offer compression
    when the client has compression requested. Since the new "delayed"
    server mode isn't supported by these older clients, they will
    refuse to connect to a new server unless compression is disabled
    (on the client end) or the original compression method is enabled
    on the server ("Compression yes" in sshd_config)

  - Another round of proactive changes for signed vs unsigned integer
    bugs has been completed, including changing the atomicio() API to
    encourage safer programming. This work is ongoing.

  - Added support for the improved arcfour cipher modes from
    draft-harris-ssh-arcfour-fixes-02. The improves the cipher's
    resistance to a number of attacks by discarding early keystream
    output.

  - Increase the default size of new RSA/DSA keys generated by
    ssh-keygen from 1024 to 2048 bits.

  - Many bugfixes and improvements to connection multiplexing,
    including:

    - Added ControlMaster=auto/autoask options to support opportunistic
      multiplexing (see the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> manpage for details).

    - The client will now gracefully fallback to starting a new TCP
      connection if it cannot connect to a specified multiplexing
      control socket

    - Added %h (target hostname), %p (target port) and %r (remote
      username) expansion sequences to ControlPath. Also allow
      ControlPath=none to disable connection multiplexing.

    - Implemented support for X11 and agent forwarding over multiplexed
      connections. Because of protocol limitations, the slave
      connections inherit the master's DISPLAY and SSH_AUTH_SOCK rather
      than distinctly forwarding their own.

  - Portable OpenSSH: Added support for long passwords (&gt; 8-char) on
    UnixWare 7.

  - The following bugs from <a href="http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/">http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/</a> were closed:

     #471  - Misleading error message if /dev/tty perms wrong
     #623  - Don't use $HOME in manpages
     #829  - Don't allocate a tty if -n option is set
     #1025 - Correctly handle disabled special character in ttymodes
     #1033 - Fix compile-time warnings
     #1046 - AIX 5.3 Garbage on Login
     #1054 - Don't terminate connection on getpeername() failure
     #1076 - GSSAPIDelegateCredentials issue mentioned above

  - Lots of other improvements and fixes. Please refer to the ChangeLog
    for details

Changes since OpenSSH 4.0:
============================ 

* This is a bugfix release, no new features have been added. Some notable
  fixes are:

  - Fix segfault when using forwardings configured in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> and 
    ClearAllForwardings (bugzilla #996)

  - Limit input buffer size for channels. A peer could send more data
    than the buffer code was willing to accept. This would cause OpenSSH
    to abort the connection (bugzilla #896)

* Several improvements to the regression tests

* Portable OpenSSH:

  - OpenSSH will now always normalise IPv4 in IPv6 mapped addresses back to 
    IPv4 addresses. This means that IPv4 addresses in log messages on IPv6
    enabled machines will no longer be prefixed by "::ffff:" and AllowUsers,
    DenyUsers, AllowGroups, DenyGroups will match IPv4-style addresses only 
    for 4-in-6 mapped connections. This ensures a consistent representation
    of IPv4 addresses regardless of whether or not the machine is IPv6
    enabled.

* Other bugfixes, including bugzilla #950, #997, #998, #999, #1005, #1006, 
  #1024, and #1038

Changes since OpenSSH 3.9:
============================ 

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> now allows the optional specification of an address to bind to 
  in port forwarding connections (local, remote and dynamic). Please 
  refer to the documentation for the -L and -R options in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> 
  manual page and the LocalForward and RemoteForward options in the 
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> manpage. (Bugzilla #413)

* To control remote bindings while retaining backwards compatibility,
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>'s GatewayPorts option has been extended. To allow client
  specified bind addresses for remote (-R) port forwardings, the server
  must be configured with "GatewayPorts clientspecified".

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and ssh-keyscan(1) now support hashing of host names and 
  addresses added to known_hosts files, controlled by the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> 
  HashKnownHosts configuration directive. This option improves user 
  privacy by hiding which hosts have been visited. At present this 
  option is off by default, but may be turned on once it receives 
  sufficient testing.

* Added options for managing keys in known_hosts files to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>,
  including the ability to search for hosts by name, delete hosts by
  name and convert an unhashed known_hosts file into one with hashed
  names. These are particularly useful for managing known_hosts files
  with hashed hostnames.

* Improve account and password expiry support in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>. Ther server 
  will now warn in advance for both account and password expiry.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> will now log the source of connections denied by AllowUsers,
  DenyUsers, AllowGroups and DenyGroups (Bugzilla #909)

* Added AddressFamily option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> to allow global control over
  IPv4/IPv6 usage. (Bugzilla #989)

* Improved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> client, including bugfixes and optimisations for the 
  ``ls'' command and command history and editing support using libedit.

* Improved the handling of bad data in authorized_keys files,
  eliminating fatal errors on corrupt or very large keys. (Bugzilla
  #884)

* Improved connection multiplexing support in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>. Several bugs 
  have been fixed and a new "command mode" has been added to allow the
  control of a running multiplexing master connection, including 
  checking that it is up, determining its PID and asking it to exit.

* Have <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> wait for the spawned ssh to exit before they
  exit themselves.  This prevents ssh from being unable to restore 
  terminal modes (not normally a problem on OpenBSD but common with 
  -Portable on POSIX platforms). (Bugzilla #950)

* Portable OpenSSH:

  - Add *EXPERIMENTAL* BSM audit support for Solaris systems 
    (Bugzilla #125)

  - Enable IPv6 on AIX where possible (see README.platform for
    details), working around a misfeature of AIX's getnameinfo. 
    (Bugzilla #835)

  - Teach <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> to write failed login records to btmp for
    unsuccessful auth attempts. Currently this is only for password,
    keyboard-interactive and challenge/response authentication methods
    and only on Linux and HP-UX.

  - <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now sends output from failing PAM session modules to the 
    user before exiting, similar to the way /etc/nologin is handled

  - Store credentials from gssapi-with-mic authentication early enough
    to be available to PAM session modules when privsep=yes.

  <pre>OpenSSH 3.9 was released on 2004-08-18. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on

and for European orders, use <a href="http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu">http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu</a>


Changes since OpenSSH 3.8:
============================ 

* Added new "IdentitiesOnly" option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, which specifies that it should
  use keys specified in ssh_config, rather than any keys in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>

* Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> re-execute itself on accepting a new connection. This security
  measure ensures that all execute-time randomisations are reapplied for each 
  connection rather than once, for the master process' lifetime. This includes
  mmap and malloc mappings, shared library addressing, shared library mapping 
  order, ProPolice and StackGhost cookies on systems that support such things

* Add strict permission and ownership checks to programs reading ~/.ssh/config
  NB <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> will now exit instead of trying to process a config with poor 
  ownership or permissions

* Implemented the ability to pass selected environment variables between the
  client and the server. See "AcceptEnv" in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a> and "SendEnv" in 
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> for details
 
* Added a "MaxAuthTries" option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, allowing control over the maximum
  number of authentication attempts permitted per connection

* Added support for cancellation of active remote port forwarding sessions. 
  This may be performed using the ~C escape character, see "Escape Characters"
  in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> for details
 
* Many <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> interface improvements, including greatly enhanced "ls" support 
  and the ability to cancel active transfers using SIGINT (^C)

* Implement session multiplexing: a single <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> connection can now carry 
  multiple login/command/file transfer sessions. Refer to the "ControlMaster" 
  and "ControlPath" options in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> for more information

* The sftp-server has improved support for non-POSIX filesystems (e.g. FAT)

* Portable OpenSSH: Re-introduce support for PAM password authentication, in 
  addition to the keyboard-interactive driver. PAM password authentication 
  is less flexible, and doesn't support pre-authentication password expiry but
  runs in-process so Kerberos tokens, etc are retained

* Improved and more extensive regression tests

* Many bugfixes and small improvements

  passwords expired longer than their maxexpired attribute.  For
  details, see the AIX section in README.platform.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> now uses untrusted cookies for X11-Forwarding.
  Some X11 applications might need full access to the X11 server,
  see ForwardX11Trusted in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and xauth(1) for more information.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> now supports sending application layer
  keep-alive messages to the server.  See ServerAliveInterval
  in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> for more information.

* Improved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> batch file support.

* New KerberosGetAFSToken option for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>.

  <pre>Portable OpenSSH 3.7.1p2  was released on 2003-09-23. It will be available 
from the mirrors listed at <a href="http://www.openssh.com/portable.html">http://www.openssh.com/portable.html</a> shortly.

Please note that this is a release to address issues in the portable 
version only. The items mentioned below do not affect the OpenBSD 
version.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Security Changes:
=================

  Portable OpenSSH version 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 contain multiple 
  vulnerabilities in the new PAM authentication code. At least one of
  these bugs is remotely exploitable (under a non-standard 
  configuration, with privsep disabled).

  OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 fixes these bugs. Please note that these bugs do not 
  exist in OpenBSD's releases of OpenSSH.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.7.1p1:
==============================

* This release disables PAM by default. To enable it, set "UsePAM yes" in 
  sshd_config. Due to complexity, inconsistencies in the specification and
  differences between vendors' PAM implementations we recommend that PAM 
  be left disabled in sshd_config unless there is a need for its use. 
  Sites using only public key or simple password authentication usually 
  have little need to enable PAM support.

* This release now requires zlib 1.1.4 to build correctly. Previous 
  versions have security problems.

* Fix compilation for versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.6. Some cipher modes 
  are not supported for older OpenSSL versions.

* Fix compilation problems on systems with a missing or lacking inet_ntoa()
  function.

* Workaround problems related to unimplemented or broken setresuid/setreuid 
  functions on several platforms.

* Fix compilation on older OpenBSD systems.

* Fix handling of password-less authentication (PermitEmptyPasswords=yes) 
  that has not worked since the 3.7p1 release.

Security Changes:
=================

  All versions of OpenSSH's sshd prior to 3.7.1 contain buffer
  management errors.  It is uncertain whether these errors are
  potentially exploitable, however, we prefer to see bugs
  fixed proactively.

  OpenSSH 3.7 fixed one of these bugs.

  OpenSSH 3.7.1 fixes more similar bugs.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.6.1:
============================ 

* The entire OpenSSH code-base has undergone a license review. As
  a result, all non-ssh1.x code is under a BSD-style license with no
  advertising requirement. Please refer to README in the source
  distribution for the exact license terms.

* Rhosts authentication has been removed in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>.

* Changes in Kerberos support:

    - KerberosV password support now uses a file cache instead of
      a memory cache.

    - KerberosIV and AFS support has been removed.

    - KerberosV support has been removed from SSH protocol 1.

    - KerberosV password authentication support remains for SSH
      protocols 1 and 2.

    - This release contains some GSSAPI user authentication support
      to replace legacy KerberosV authentication support. At present
      this code is still considered experimental and SHOULD NOT BE
      USED.
  
* Changed order that keys are tried in public key authentication.
  The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> client tries the keys in the following order:

     1. <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a> keys that are found in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> file
     2. remaining <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a> keys
     3. keys that are only listed in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> file

  This helps when an <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a> has many keys, where the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>
  server might close the connection before the correct key is tried.

* SOCKS5 support has been added to the dynamic forwarding mode
  in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>.

* Removed implementation barriers to operation of SSH over SCTP.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> client can now transfer files with quote characters in
  their filenames.

* Replaced <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>'s VerifyReverseMapping with UseDNS option.
  When UseDNS option is on, reverse hostname lookups are always
  performed.

* Fix a number of memory leaks.

* Support for sending tty BREAK over SSH protocol 2.

* Workaround for other vendor bugs in KEX guess handling.

* Support for generating KEX-GEX groups (/etc/moduli) in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>.

* Automatic re-keying based on amount of data sent over connection.

* New AddressFamily option on client to select protocol to use (IPv4
  or IPv6).

* Experimental support for the "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", and
  "aes256-ctr" ciphers for SSH protocol 2.

* Experimental support for host keys in DNS (draft-ietf-secsh-dns-xx.txt).
  Please see README.dns in the source distribution for details.

* Portable OpenSSH:

    - Replace PAM password authentication kludge with a more correct
      PAM challenge-response module from FreeBSD.

    - PAM support may now be enabled/disabled at runtime using the
      UsePAM directive.

    - Many improvements to the OpenSC smartcard support.

    - Regression tests now work with portable OpenSSH.
      Please refer to regress/README.regress in the source distribution.

    - On platforms that support it, portable OpenSSH now honors the
      UMASK, PATH and SUPATH attributes set in /etc/default/login.

    - Deny access to locked accounts, regardless of authentication
      method in use.

    - Many improvements to the OpenSC smartcard support.

    - Regression tests now work with portable OpenSSH.
      Please refer to regress/README.regress in the source distribution.

    - On platforms that support it, portable OpenSSH now honors the
      UMASK, PATH and SUPATH attributes set in /etc/default/login.

    - Deny access to locked accounts, regardless of authentication
      method in use.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.6:
========================== 

* The 'kex guesses' bugfix from OpenSSH 3.6 triggers a bug
  in a few other SSH v2 implementations and causes connections to
  stall.  OpenSSH 3.6.1 disables this bugfix when interoperating
  with these implementations.


Changes between OpenSSH 3.5 and OpenSSH 3.6:
============================================

* RSA blinding is now used by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>.
  in order to avoid potential timing attacks against the RSA keys.
  Older versions of OpenSSH have been using RSA blinding in
  ssh-keysign(1) only.

  Please note that there is no evidence that the SSH protocol is
  vulnerable to the OpenSSL/TLS timing attack described in
        <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf">http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf</a>

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a> optionally requires user confirmation if a key gets
  used, see '-c' in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now handles PermitRootLogin correctly when UsePrivilegeSeparation
  is enabled.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now removes X11 cookies when a session gets closed.

* ssh-keysign(8) is disabled by default and only enabled if the
  new EnableSSHKeysign option is set in the global <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a>
  file.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now handle 'kex guesses' correctly (key exchange
  guesses).

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> no longer overwrites SIG_IGN.  This matches behaviour from
  rsh(1) and is used by backup tools.

* setting ProxyCommand to 'none' disables the proxy feature, see
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a>.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> supports add -1 and -2.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> supports bandwidth limiting.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> displays a progressmeter.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.4:
============================ 

* Improved support for Privilege Separation (Portability, Kerberos,
  PermitRootLogin handling).

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> prints out all known host keys for a host if it receives an
  unknown host key of a different type.

* Fixed AES/Rijndael EVP integration for OpenSSL &lt; 0.9.7 (caused
  problems with bounds checking patches for gcc).

* ssh-keysign(8) is disabled by default and only enabled if the
  HostbasedAuthentication option is enabled in the global <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a>
  file.

* ssh-keysign(8) uses RSA blinding in order to avoid timing attacks
  against the RSA host key.

* A use-after-free bug was fixed in ssh-keysign(8).  This bug
  broke hostbased authentication on several platforms.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a> is now installed setgid in order to avoid ptrace(2)
  attacks.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a> now restricts the access with getpeereid(2) (or
  equivalent, where available).

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> no longer uses the ASN.1 parsing code from libcrypto when
  verifying RSA signatures.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> now sets the SSH_CONNECTION environment variable.

* Enhanced "ls" support for the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a> client, including globbing and
  detailed listings.

* <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> now always falls back to uncompressed sessions, if the
  server does not support compression.

* The default behavior of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> with regard to user settable
  environ variables has changed:  the new option PermitUserEnvironment
  is disabled by default, see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>.

* The default value for LoginGraceTime has been changed from 600 to 120
  seconds, see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>.

* Removed erroneous SO_LINGER handling.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.3:
============================ 

Security Changes:
=================

  All versions of OpenSSH's sshd between 2.9.9 and 3.3
  contain an input validation error that can result in
  an integer overflow and privilege escalation.

  OpenSSH 3.4 fixes this bug.

  In addition, OpenSSH 3.4 adds many checks to detect 
  invalid input and mitigate resource exhaustion attacks.

  OpenSSH 3.2 and later prevent privilege escalation
  if UsePrivilegeSeparation is enabled in sshd_config.
  OpenSSH 3.3 enables UsePrivilegeSeparation by
  default.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.2.3:
============================ 

Security Changes:
=================

- improved support for privilege separation:

	privilege separation is now enabled by default

  See UsePrivilegeSeparation in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>
  and <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html">http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html</a> for more
  information.
- ssh no longer needs to be installed setuid root for protocol
  version 2 hostbased authentication, see ssh-keysign(8).
  protocol version 1 rhosts-rsa authentication still requires privileges
  and is not recommended.

Other Changes:
==============

- documentation for the client and server configuration options have
  been moved to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>.
- the server now supports the Compression option, see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>.
- the client options RhostsRSAAuthentication and RhostsAuthentication now
  default to no, see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a>.
- the client options FallBackToRsh and UseRsh are deprecated.
- ssh-agent now supports locking and timeouts for keys, see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>.
- ssh-agent can now bind to unix-domain sockets given on the command line,
  see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>.
- fixes problems with valid RSA signatures from putty clients.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.2.2:
============================ 

  This release fixes several problems in OpenSSH 3.2.2:

    - a defect in the BSD_AUTH access control handling for
      OpenBSD and BSD/OS systems:

      Under certain conditions, on systems using YP with netgroups
      in the password database, it is possible that sshd does ACL
      checks for the requested user name but uses the password
      database entry of a different user for authentication. This
      means that denied users might authenticate successfully while
      permitted users could be locked out (OpenBSD PR 2659).

    - login/tty problems on Solaris (bug #245)

    - build problems on Cygwin systems


Changes between OpenSSH 3.1 and OpenSSH 3.2.2:
==============================================

  Security Changes:
  =================
  
  - fixed buffer overflow in Kerberos/AFS token passing
  - fixed overflow in Kerberos client code
  - sshd no longer auto-enables Kerberos/AFS
  - experimental support for privilege separation,
    see UsePrivilegeSeparation in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> and
  	  <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html">http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html</a>
    for more information.
  - only accept RSA keys of size SSH_RSA_MINIMUM_MODULUS_SIZE (768) or larger
  
  Other Changes:
  ==============
  
  - improved smartcard support (including support for OpenSC,
    see www.opensc.org)
  - improved Kerberos support (including support for MIT-Kerberos V)
  - fixed stderr handling in protocol v2
  - client reports failure if -R style TCP forwarding fails in protocol v2
  - support configuration of TCP forwarding during interactive sessions (~C)
  - improved support for older sftp servers
  - improved support for importing old DSA keys (from ssh.com software).
  - client side suport for PASSWD_CHANGEREQ in protocol v2
  - fixed waitpid race conditions
  - record correct lastlogin time

  <pre>OpenSSH 3.0.2 was released on 2002-12-04. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

        This release fixes a vulnerability in the UseLogin option
        of OpenSSH.  This option is not enabled in the default
        installation of OpenSSH.

        However, if UseLogin is enabled by the administrator, all
        versions of OpenSSH prior to 3.0.2 may be vulnerable to
        local attacks.

        The vulnerability allows local users to pass environment
        variables (e.g. LD_PRELOAD) to the login process.  The login
        process is run with the same privilege as sshd (usually
        with root privilege).

        Do not enable UseLogin on your machines or disable UseLogin
        again in /etc/sshd_config:
		UseLogin no

We also have received many reports about attacks against the crc32
bug.  This bug has been fixed about 12 months ago in OpenSSH 2.3.0.
However, these attacks cause non-vulnerable daemons to chew a lot
of cpu since the crc32 attack sends a tremendously large amount of
data which must be processed.

Kevin Steves, Damien Miller and Ben Lindstrom.



The following patch fixes the UseLogin vulnerability in OpenSSH 3.0.1 and
earlier releases.

Important Changes:
==================

        A security hole that may allow an attacker to authenticate
        if -- and only if -- the administrator has enabled KerberosV.
        By default, OpenSSH KerberosV support only becomes active
        after KerberosV has been properly configured.

        An excessive memory clearing bug (which we believe to be
        unexploitable) also exists, but since this may cause daemon
        crashes, we are providing a fix as well.

        Various other non-critical fixes (~&amp; support and more).

  <pre>OpenSSH 3.0 was released on 2001-11-06. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

This release contains many portability bug-fixes (listed in the
ChangeLog) as well as several new features (listed below).

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

1) SSH protocol v2 is now the default protocol version

	use the 'Protocol' option from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> if
	you need to change this.

2) The files
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
   are now obsolete, you can use
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts
	~/.ssh/known_hosts
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   For backward compatibility ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 will still used for
   authentication and hostkeys are still read from the known_hosts2.
   However, those deprecated files are considered 'readonly'.  Future
   releases are likely not to read these files.

3) The CheckMail option in sshd_config is deprecated, as <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> no longer
   checks for new mail.

4) X11 cookies are now stored in $HOME.

New Features:
=============

1) Smartcard support in the ssh client and agent based on work by
   University of Michigan CITI (<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/smartcard/)">http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/smartcard/)</a>.
2) support for Rekeying in protocol version 2

3) improved Kerberos support in protocol v1 (KerbIV and KerbV)

4) backward compatibility with older commercial SSH versions &gt;= 2.0.10

5) getopt(3) is now used by all programs

6) dynamic forwarding (use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> as your socks server)

7) ClearAllForwardings in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>

8) <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> now checks the hostkey for localhost (NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes/no).

9) -F option in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>

10) <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a> now has a '-b bindaddress' option

11) <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a> allows "scp /file localhost:/file"

12) The AuthorizedKeysFile option allows specification of alternative
    files that contain the public keys that can be used for user authentication
    (e.g. /etc/ssh_keys/%u, see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>)

13) extended AllowUsers user@host syntax in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>

14) improved challenge-response support (especially for systems supporting BSD_AUTH)

15) <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> can specify time args as 1h, 2h30s etc.

16) <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> transmits the correct exit status for remote execution with protocol version 2.

17) <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a> can import private RSA/DSA keys generated with the commercial version

18) ssh-keyscan(1) supports protocol version 2

  <pre>OpenSSH 2.9.9 has just been uploaded. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH 2.9.9 fixes a weakness in the key file option handling,
including source IP based access control.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

This release contains many portability bug-fixes (listed in the
ChangeLog) as well as several new features (listed below).

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Security Notes:
===============

This release fixes weakness in the source IP based access control
for SSH protocol v2 public key authentication:

        Versions of OpenSSH between 2.5 and 2.9.9 are
        affected if they use the 'from=' key file option in
        combination with both RSA and DSA keys in
        ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2.

        Depending on the order of the user keys in
        ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 sshd might fail to apply the
        source IP based access control restriction (e.g.
        from="10.0.0.1") to the correct key:

        If a source IP restricted key (e.g. DSA key) is
        immediately followed by a key of a different type
        (e.g. RSA key), then key options for the second key
        are applied to both keys, which includes 'from='.

	This means that users can circumvent the system policy
	and login from disallowed source IP addresses.
	

Important Changes:
==================

OpenSSH 2.9.9 might have upgrade issues introduced by the long time
between releases, which may affect people in unforseen ways:

1) The files
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
   are now obsolete, you can use
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts
	~/.ssh/known_hosts
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   For backward compatibility ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 is still used for
   authentication and hostkeys are still read from the known_hosts2.
   However, old files are considered 'readonly'.  Future releases are
   likely to not read these files.

2) The CheckMail option in sshd_config is deprecated, sshd no longer
   checks for new mail.

3) X11 cookies are stored in $HOME

  <pre>Portable OpenSSH 2.5.2p2 is now available from the mirror sites
listed at <a href="http://www.openssh.com/portable.html">http://www.openssh.com/portable.html</a>

Security related changes:
	Improved countermeasure against "Passive Analysis of SSH
	(Secure Shell) Traffic"
	<a href="http://openwall.com/advisories/OW-003-ssh-traffic-analysis.txt">http://openwall.com/advisories/OW-003-ssh-traffic-analysis.txt</a>

	The countermeasures introduced in earlier OpenSSH-2.5.x versions
	caused interoperability problems with some other implementations.

	Improved countermeasure against "SSH protocol 1.5 session
	key recovery vulnerability"
	<a href="http://www.core-sdi.com/advisories/ssh1_sessionkey_recovery.htm">http://www.core-sdi.com/advisories/ssh1_sessionkey_recovery.htm</a>

New options:
	permitopen authorized_keys option to restrict portforwarding.

	PreferredAuthentications allows client to specify the order in which
	authentication methods are tried.

Sftp:
	sftp client supports globbing (get *, put *).

	Support for sftp protocol v3 (draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-01.txt).

	Batch file (-b) support for automated transfers

Performance:
	Speedup DH exchange. OpenSSH should now be significantly faster when
	connecting use SSH protocol 2.

	Preferred SSH protocol 2 cipher is AES with hmac-md5. AES offers
	much faster throughput in a well scrutinised cipher.

Bugfixes:
	stderr handling fixes in SSH protocol 2.

	Improved interoperability.

Client:
	The client no longer asks for the the passphrase if the key
	will not be accepted by the server (SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK)

Miscellaneous:
	scp should now work for files &gt; 2GB

	ssh-keygen can now generate fingerprints in the "bubble babble"
	format for exchanging fingerprints with SSH.COM's SSH protocol 2
	implementation.

Portable version:
	Better support for the PRNGd[1] entropy collection daemon. The
	--with-egd-pool configure option has been deprecated in favour
	of --with-prngd-socket and the new --with-prngd-port options.
	The latter allows collection of entropy from a localhost
	socket.

	configure ensures that scp is in the $PATH set by the server
	(unless a custom path is specified).

This release contains primarily bug-fixes over 2.5.1p1 but an upgrade is
recommended. Specific bug-fixes include:

 - Fixed endianess issue causing failues when usin Rijndael/AES cipher
 - Fix PAM failures on Solaris and Linux
 - Fix RPM spec file for Redhat systems
 - Fixed several compatibility functions
 - Fix entropy collection code for SCO3 and NeXTStep
 - Many other minor fixes (see Changelog for details)

This release includes Mark Roth's mdoc2man.pl script which can be used
to fix up the manpages on systems that lack the full andoc set of
macros (e.g. Solaris). A future release of portable OpenSSH will automate
this scripts use for systems that require it.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH 1.3 &amp; 1.5 protocol implementation and 
a 99% SSH 2 protocol implementation, including sftp client and server
support.

This release contains many portability bug-fixes (listed in the
ChangeLog) as well as several new features (listed below).

OpenSSH 2.5.0p1 was skipped because of interoperability issues with 
ssh-1.2.18 =&gt; ssh-1.2.22.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued support
and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

1) Features added to the implementation of the SSH 2 protocol:

    * agent forwarding
    * support for -R forwarding
    * RSA host and userkeys
    * extended support for older SSH 2 protocol implementations

    OpenSSH still lacks support for rekeying, so you have to turn off
    rekeying if your server tries to force this feature.

    The next release of OpenSSH will probably support rekeying.

2) Damien Miller contributed an interactive sftp client.

    The sftp client works for both SSH protocol versions.

3) David Mazieres' ssh-keyscan has been added to the OpenSSH distribution.

4) Now there are three types of keys in OpenSSH:

    RSA1 is used by the SSH 1 protocol only,
    RSA and DSA keys are used by the SSH 2 protocol implementation.

    You can generate RSA keys for use with SSH 2 protocol with:

        $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh_host_rsa_key

        To use RSA or DSA keys in SSH 2 protocol, simply
        add the public keys to the .ssh/authorised_keys2 file.

    IdentityFile2, HostDsaKey and DSAAuthentication are obsolete:

    You can use multiple IdentityFile and HostKey options instead, e.g
        HostKey /etc/ssh_host_key
        HostKey /etc/ssh_host_dsa_key
        HostKey /etc/ssh_host_rsa_key
    in /etc/sshd_config

    The option DSAAuthentication has been replaced by PubkeyAuthentication.

    Fingerprinting works for all types of keys:

        $ ssh-keygen -l -f $HOME/.ssh/{authorized_keys,known_hosts}{,2}

5) Important changes in the implementation of SSH 1 protocol:

    The OpenSSH server does not require a privileged source port for
    RhostsRsaAuthentication, since it adds no additional security.

    Interoperation with SSH 1.4 protocol

6) New option HostKeyAlias

    This option allows the user to record the host key under a
    different name. This is useful for tunneling over
    forwarded connections or if you run multiple sshd's on
    different ports on the same machine.

    Alternatively you can use the UserKnownHostsFile or 
    UserKnownHostsFile2 options to specify seperate host key
    files for the connection.

7) The ReverseMappingCheck is now optional in sshd_config.

    If you combine this with the 'sshd -u0' option the server
    will not do DNS lookups when a client connects.

8) Stricter Hostkey Checking

9) Option Change Summary:

    a) New or changed:

        ChallengeResponseAuthentication
        MACs
        PubkeyAuthentication

        HostkeyAlias        (Client only)

        Banner              (Server only)
        ReverseMappingCheck (Server only)

        PermitRootLogin     {yes,without-password,forced-commands-only,no}

        {Allow,Deny}Groups  now support supplementary groups

        sshd -D             for monitoring scripts or inittab
        ssh -t              multiple -t force tty allocation

    b) Obsolete:

        DsaAuthentication   (use PubkeyAuthentication instead)
        HostDsaKey          (use HostKey)
        Identityfile2       (use Identityfile or -i)
        SkeyAuthentication  (use ChallengeResponseAuthentication)
        TisAuthentication   (use ChallengeResponseAuthentication)

  <h3><a href="txt/release-2.1.1p3" id="2.1.1p3">OpenSSH 2.1.1p3</a> (2000-07-12)</h3> 
  <pre>
The 2.1.1p3 release of portable OpenSSH has been uploaded to the
OpenBSD ftp master site. In a few hours it will be available from one
of the many mirrors listed at:

<a href="http://www.openssh.com/portable.html">http://www.openssh.com/portable.html</a>

This release fixes several bugs reported since the previous release
and extends portability to NeXT and Reliant Unix.

As usual, the OpenBSD team has been hard at work further polishing and
enhancing OpenSSH. This release brings a new configuration directive
"MaxStartups" which mitigates connection flooding attacks, further
details are in the sshd man-page.

Another noteworthy difference from previous releases is that
'FallBackToRsh' now defaults to 'no'. Users of this feature may need
to edit their /etc/ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config files to achieve the
same behavior.

Again, thanks to those who reported bugs, tested the snapshot and sent
fixes.

Regards,
Damien Miller

  <pre>Announcing the availability of portable OpenSSH 2.1.1p1.

This release contains the fix for the "UseLogin yes" vulnerability
identified in Markus' release and several other enhancements and
bugfixes. Including:

 - Better login code. Andre Lucas has rewritten the login code to 
   be much more modular and extensible. In the process he has fixed 
   the problems with Solaris utmp[x].

 - Revised the entropy collection code to be faster and more reliable.

 - Fix for RSA host restrictions ("from=" in authorized_keys)

It is recommended that all users upgrade to this version.

  <h3><a href="txt/release-2.1.0p1" id="2.1.0p1">OpenSSH 2.1.0p1</a> (2000-05-09)</h3> 
  <pre>
This is to announce the release of openssh-2.1.0, the first stable
release of portable OpenSSH to incorporate support for the SSH2
protocol.

The SSH2 protocol offers a number of advantages over the SSH1 protocol
including standards compliance (SSH2 is on the IETF standards
track[1]), improved security and operation without RSA (which is
patented in some countries).

The SSH2 support in OpenSSH has been developed by Markus Friedl, with
support from the OpenBSD team.

This is also the first version of the portable version of OpenSSH
to offer built-in entropy collection. This removes the requirement
for EGD on systems that lack a /dev/random driver. As a result,
OpenSSH-2.1.0 now requires a recent version of OpenSSL[2] to compile
(version 0.9.5 or later).

NB. The portable version of OpenSSH is currently in the
process of merging its webpages with the official OpenBSD
project. Please use <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">http://www.openssh.com/</a> from now
on. Distribution files are also available from the mirrors listed at
<a href="http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html">http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html</a>

Please read <a href="http://www.openssh.com/report.html">http://www.openssh.com/report.html</a> before reporting bugs.
Patches, bug reports, developer and user queries are welcome on the
mailing list (<a href="http://www.openssh.com/list.html)">http://www.openssh.com/list.html)</a>.

  <pre>
The Unix/Linux port of OpenSSH 1.2.3 was released yesterday and should
be available from a mirror near you. A mirror list is available from:

<a href="http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html">http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html</a>

This release fixes the bugs reported since 1.2.2p1 and contains many
cleanups from the OpenBSD tree.

In particular, the OpenSSL detection problems have been resolved.

The layout has changed a little bit. The packages/ subdirectory has
been replaced with a contrib/ subdirectory which contains platform
specific code and other patches. Submissions are welcome.

Enjoy,
Damien Miller

  <pre>
It gives me no little pleasure to announce the first stable release
of the Unix port of OpenSSH. 

It is available in tar.gz and RPM format from one of the mirrors
listed at:

<a href="http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html">http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html</a>

This release fixes all known issues and is known to compile and
function on (at least) recent releases on Linux, Solaris, HPUX and SCO
Unixware.

Please review the ChangeLog[1] for details on what has changed since
the last release.

I am holding off on a wider announcement until the mirrors have
updated.

Thanks to everyone who assisted with testing, bug reports, success
stories and most of all, patches :) Special thanks to the OpenBSD
developers for giving us OpenSSH to begin with.

Regards,
Damien Miller
